  <div class="subheadc">FORT LEAVENWORTH, <i>LOWER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> readers, I presume, will have felt some anxiety for me and the
    fate of my little craft, after the close of my last Letter; and I have
    the very great satisfaction of announcing to them that we escaped
    <em>snags</em> and <em>sawyers</em>, and every other danger, and arrived
    here safe from the Upper Missouri, where my last letters were dated.
    We, (that is, Ba’tiste, Bogard and I,) are comfortably quartered for
    awhile, in the barracks of this hospitable Cantonment, which is now the
    extreme Western military post on the frontier, and under the command
    of Colonel Davenport, a gentleman of great urbanity of manners, with
    a Roman head and a Grecian heart, restrained and tempered by the
    charms of an American lady, who has elegantly pioneered the graces of
    civilized refinements into these uncivilized regions.</p>

  <p>This Cantonment, which is beautifully situated on the west bank of the
    Missouri River, and six hundred miles above its mouth, was constructed
    some years since by General Leavenworth, from whom it has taken its
    name. Its location is very beautiful, and so is the country around
    it. It is the concentration point of a number of hostile tribes in
    the vicinity, and has its influence in restraining their warlike
    propensities.</p>

  <p>There is generally a regiment of men stationed here, for the purpose of
    holding the Indians in check, and of preserving the peace amongst the
    hostile tribes. I shall visit several tribes in this vicinity, and most
    assuredly give you some further account of them, as fast as I get it.</p>

  <p>Since the date of my last epistles, I succeeded in descending the river
    to this place, in my little canoe, with my two men at the oars, and
    myself at the helm, steering its course the whole way amongst snags and
    sand-bars.</p>

  <p>Before I give further account of this downward voyage, however, I
    must recur back for a few moments, to the Teton River, from whence I
    started, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> from whence my last epistles were written, to record a
    few more incidents which I then overlooked in my note-book. Whilst
    painting my portraits amongst the Sioux, as I have described, I got the
    portrait of a noble Shienne chief, by the name of Nee-hee-o-ee-woo-tis,
    the wolf on the hill (<a href="#i_115"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 115</a>). The chief of a party of
    that tribe, on a friendly visit to the Sioux, and the portrait also of
    a woman, Tis-see-woo-na-tis (she who bathes her knees, <a href="#i_116"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    116</a>). The Shiennes are a small tribe of about 3000 in numbers, living
    neighbours to the Sioux, on the west of them, and between the Black
    Hills and the Rocky Mountains. There is no finer race of men than these
    in North America, and none superior in stature, excepting the Osages;
    scarcely a man in the tribe, full grown, who is less than six feet in
    height. The Shiennes are undoubtedly the richest in horses of any tribe
    on the Continent, living in a country as they do, where the greatest
    herds of wild horses are grazing on the prairies, which they catch in
    great numbers and vend to the Sioux, Mandans and other tribes, as well
    as to the Fur Traders.</p>

  <p>These people are the most desperate set of horsemen, and warriors also,
    having carried on almost unceasing wars with the Pawnees and Blackfeet,
    “time out of mind.” The chief represented in the picture was clothed in
    a handsome dress of deer skins, very neatly garnished with broad bands
    of porcupine quill-work down the sleeves of his shirt and his leggings,
    and all the way fringed with scalp-locks. His hair was very profuse,
    and flowing over his shoulders; and in his hand he held a beautiful
    Sioux pipe, which had just been presented to him by Mr. M‘Kenzie, the
    Trader. This was one of the finest looking and most dignified men that
    I have met in the Indian country; and from the account given of him
    by the Traders a man of honour and strictest integrity. The woman was
    comely, and beautifully dressed; her dress of the mountain-sheep skins,
    tastefully ornamented with quills and beads, and her hair plaited in
    large braids, that hung down on her breast.</p>

  <p>After I had painted these and many more, whom I have not time at
    present to name, I painted the portrait of a celebrated warrior of
    the Sioux, by the name of Mah-to-chee-ga (the little bear), who was
    unfortunately slain in a few moments after the picture was done, by
    one of his own tribe; and which was very near costing me my life for
    having painted a side view of his face, leaving one-half of it out of
    the picture, which had been the cause of the affray; and supposed by
    the whole tribe to have been intentionally left out by me, as “good for
    nothing.” This was the last picture that I painted amongst the Sioux,
    and the last, undoubtedly, that I ever shall paint in that place. So
    tremendous and so alarming was the excitement about it, that my brushes
    were instantly put away, and I embarked the next day on the steamer for
    the sources of the Missouri, and was glad to get underweigh.</p>

  <p>The man who slew this noble warrior was a troublesome fellow of the
    same tribe, by the name of Shon-ka (the dog). A “hue and cry” has been
    on his track for several months; and my life having been repeatedly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>threatened during my absence up the river, I shall defer telling
    the whole of this most extraordinary affair, until I see that my own
    scalp is safe, and I am successfully out of the country. A few weeks or
    months will decide how many are to fall victims to the vengeance of the
    relatives of this murdered brave: and if I outlive the affair, I shall
    certainly give some further account of it.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>My voyage from the mouth of the Teton River to this place has been
    the most rugged, yet the most delightful, of my whole Tour. Our canoe
    was generally landed at night on the point of some projecting barren
    sand-bar, where we straightened our limbs on our buffalo robes,
    secure from the annoyance of musquitoes, and out of the walks of
    Indians and grizzly bears. In addition to the opportunity which this
    descending Tour has afforded me, of visiting all the tribes of Indians
    on the river, and leisurely filling my portfolio with the beautiful
    scenery which its shores present—the sportsman’s fever was roused and
    satisfied; the swan, ducks, geese, and pelicans—the deer, antelope,
    elk, and buffaloes, were “<em>stretched</em>” by our rifles; and some
    times—“pull boys! pull!! a war party! for your lives pull! or we are
    gone!”</p>

  <p>I often landed my skiff, and mounted the green carpeted bluffs, whose
    soft grassy tops, invited me to recline, where I was at once lost in
    contemplation. Soul melting scenery that was about me! A place where
    the mind could think volumes; but the tongue must be silent that
    would <em>speak</em>, and the hand palsied that would <em>write</em>.
    A place where a Divine would confess that he never had fancied
    Paradise—where the painter’s palette would lose its beautiful tints—the
    blood-stirring notes of eloquence would die in their utterance—and
    even the soft tones of sweet music would scarcely preserve a spark
    to light the soul again that had passed this sweet delirium. I mean
    the prairie, whose enamelled plains that lie beneath me, in distance
    soften into sweetness, like an essence; whose thousand thousand
    velvet-covered hills, (surely never formed by chance, but grouped in
    one of Nature’s sportive moods)—tossing and leaping down with steep or
    graceful declivities to the river’s edge, as if to grace its pictured
    shores, and make it “a thing to look upon.” I mean the prairie at
    <em>sun-set</em>; when the green hill-tops are turned into gold—and their
    long shadows of melancholy are thrown over the valleys—when all the
    breathings of day are hushed, and nought but the soft notes of the
    retiring dove can be heard; or the still softer and more plaintive
    notes of the wolf, who sneaks through these scenes of enchantment, and
    mournfully how—l——s, as if lonesome, and lost in the too beautiful
    quiet and stillness about him. I mean <em>this</em> prairie; where
    Heaven sheds its purest light, and lends its richest tints—<em>this
    round-topp’d bluff</em>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>where the foot treads soft and light—whose
    steep sides, and lofty head, rear me to the skies, overlooking yonder
    pictured vale of beauty—this solitary <em>cedar-post</em>, which tells
    a tale of grief—grief that was keenly felt, and tenderly, but long
    since softened in the march of time and lost. Oh, sad and tear-starting
    contemplation! sole tenant of this stately mound, how solitary thy
    habitation! here Heaven wrested from thee thy ambition, and made thee
    sleeping monarch of this land of silence.</p>

  <p>Stranger! oh, how the mystic web of sympathy links my soul to thee and
    thy afflictions! I knew thee not, but it was enough; thy tale was told,
    and I a solitary wanderer through thy land, have stopped to
    drop familiar tears upon thy grave. Pardon this gush from a stranger’s
    eyes, for they are all that thou canst have in this strange land, where
    friends and dear relations are not allowed to pluck a flower, and drop
    a tear to freshen recollections of endearments past.</p>

  <p>Stranger! adieu. With streaming eyes I leave thee again, and thy
    fairy land, to peaceful solitude. My pencil has faithfully traced thy
    beautiful habitation; and long shall live in the world, and familiar,
    the name of “<em>Floyd’s Grave</em>.”</p>

  <p>Readers, pardon this digression. I have seated myself down, not on a
    prairie, but at my table, by a warm and cheering fire, with my journal
    before me to cull from it a few pages, for your entertainment; and if
    there are spots of loveliness and beauty, over which I have passed, and
    whose images are occasionally beckoning me into digressions, you must
    forgive me.</p>

  <p>Such is the spot I have just named, and some others, on to which I am
    instantly transferred when I cast my eyes back upon the enamelled and
    beautiful shores of the Upper Missouri; and I am constrained to step
    aside and give ear to their breathings, when their soft images, and
    cherished associations, so earnestly prompt me. “Floyd’s Grave” is a
    name given to one of the most lovely and imposing mounds or bluffs on
    the Missouri River, about twelve hundred miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, from
    the melancholy fate of Serjeant Floyd, who was of Lewis and Clark’s
    expedition, in 1806; who died on the way, and whose body was taken to
    this beautiful hill, and buried in its top, where now stands a cedar
    post, hearing the initials of his name (<a href="#i_118"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 118</a>).</p>

  <p>I landed my canoe in front of this grass-covered mound, and all hands
    being fatigued, we encamped a couple of days at its base. I several
    times ascended it and sat upon his grave, overgrown with grass and
    the most delicate wild flowers, where I sat and contemplated the
    solitude and stillness of this tenanted mound; and beheld from its
    top, the windings infinite of the Missouri, and its thousand hills and
    domes of green, vanishing into blue in distance, when nought but the
    soft-breathing winds were heard, to break the stillness and quietude
    of the scene. Where not the chirping of bird or sound of cricket,
    nor soaring eagle’s scream, were internosed ’tween God and man; nor
    aught to check man’s whole surrender of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>his soul to his Creator. I
    could not <em>hunt</em> upon this ground, but I roamed from hill-top to
    hill-top, and culled wild flowers, and looked into the valley below me,
    both up the river and down, and contemplated the thousand hills and
    dales that are now carpeted with green, streaked as they <em>will</em>
    be, with the plough, and yellow with the harvest sheaf; spotted
    with lowing kine—with houses and fences, and groups of hamlets and
    villas—and these lovely hill-tops ringing with the giddy din and maze,
    or secret earnest whispers of lovesick swains—of pristine simplicity
    and virtue—wholesome and well-earned contentment and abundance—and
    again, of wealth and refinements—of idleness and luxury—of vice and
    its deformities—of fire and sword, and the vengeance of offended
    Heaven, wreaked in retributive destruction!—and peace, and quiet, and
    loveliness, and silence, dwelling <em>again</em>, over and through these
    scenes, and blending them into futurity!</p>

  <p>Many such scenes there are, and thousands, on the Missouri shores.
    My canoe has been stopped, and I have clambered up their grassy and
    flower-decked sides; and sighed all alone, as I have carefully traced
    and fastened them in colours on my canvass.</p>

  <p>This voyage in my little canoe, amid the thousand islands and
    grass-covered bluffs that stud the shores of this mighty river,
    afforded me infinite pleasure, mingled with pains and privations which
    I never shall wish to forget. Gliding along from day to day, and tiring
    our eyes on the varying landscapes that were continually opening to
    our view, my merry <em>voyageurs</em> were continually chaunting their
    cheerful boat songs, and “every now and then,” taking up their unerring
    rifles to bring down the stately elks or antelopes, which were often
    gazing at us from the shores of the river.</p>

  <p>But a few miles from “Floyd’s Bluff” we landed our canoe, and spent
    a day in the vicinity of the “<em>Black Bird’s Grave</em>.” This is a
    celebrated point on the Missouri, and a sort of telegraphic place,
    which all the travellers in these realms, both white and red, are in
    the habit of visiting: the one to pay respect to the bones of one of
    their distinguished leaders; and the others, to indulge their eyes
    on the lovely landscape that spreads out to an almost illimitable
    extent in every direction about it. This elevated bluff, which may
    be distinguished for several leagues in distance (<a href="#i_117"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    117</a>), has received the name of the “Black Bird’s Grave,” from the
    fact, that a famous chief of the O-ma-haws, by the name of the Black
    Bird, was buried on its top, at his own peculiar request; over whose
    grave a cedar post was erected by his tribe some thirty years ago,
    which is still standing. The O-ma-haw village was about sixty miles
    above this place; and this very noted chief, who had been on a visit
    to Washington City, in company with the Indian agent, died of the
    small-pox, near this spot, on his return home. And, whilst dying,
    enjoined on his warriors who were about him, this singular request,
    which was literally complied with. He requested them to take his body
    down the river to this his favourite haunt, and on the pinnacle of this
    towering bluff, to bury him on the back of his favourite war-horse,
    which was to be buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> alive, under him, from whence he could see,
    as he said, “the Frenchmen passing up and down the river in their
    boats.” He owned, amongst many horses, a noble white steed that was
    led to the top of the grass-covered hill; and, with great pomp and
    ceremony, in presence of the whole nation, and several of the Fur
    Traders and the Indian agent, he was placed astride of his horse’s
    back, with his bow in his hand, and his shield and quiver slung—with
    his pipe and his <em>medicine-bag</em>—with his supply of dried meat, and
    his tobacco-pouch replenished to last him through his journey to the
    “beautiful hunting grounds of the shades of his fathers”—with his flint
    and steel, and his tinder, to light his pipes by the way. The scalps
    that he had taken from his enemies’ heads, could be trophies for nobody
    else, and were hung to the bridle of his horse—he was in full dress
    and fully equipped; and on his head waved, to the last moment, his
    beautiful head-dress of the war-eagle’s plumes. In this plight, and the
    last funeral honours having been performed by the <em>medicine-men</em>,
    every warrior of his band painted the palm and fingers of his right
    hand with vermilion; which was stamped, and perfectly impressed on the
    milk-white sides of his devoted horse.</p>

  <p>This all done, turfs were brought and placed around the feet and legs
    of the horse, and gradually laid up to its sides; and at last, over the
    back and head of the unsuspecting animal, and last of all, over the
    head and even the eagle plumes of its valiant rider, where altogether
    have smouldered and remained undisturbed to the present day.</p>

  <p>This mound which is covered with a green turf, and spotted with wild
    flowers, with its cedar post in its centre, can easily be seen at the
    distance of fifteen miles, by the <em>voyageur</em>, and forms for him a
    familiar and useful land-mark.</p>

  <p>Whilst visiting this mound in company with Major Sanford, on our way up
    the river, I discovered in a hole made in the mound, by a “ground hog”
    or other animal, the skull of the horse; and by a little pains, also
    came at the skull of the chief, which I carried to the river side, and
    secreted till my return in my canoe, when I took it in, and brought
    with me to this place, where I now have it, with others which I have
    collected on my route.</p>

  <p>There have been some very surprising tales told of this man, which
    will render him famous in history, whether they be truth or matters of
    fiction. Of the many, one of the most current is, that he gained his
    celebrity and authority by the most diabolical series of murders in his
    own tribe; by administering arsenic (with which he had been supplied
    by the Fur Traders) to such of his enemies as he wished to get rid
    of—and even to others in his tribe whom he was willing to sacrifice,
    merely to establish his superhuman powers, and the most servile dread
    of the tribe, from the certainty with which his victims fell around
    him, precisely at the times he saw fit to predict their death! It has
    been said that he administered this potent drug, and to them unknown
    <em>medicine</em>, to many of his friends as well as to foes; and by such
    an inhuman and unparalleled depravity, succeeded in exercising the most
    despotic and absolute authority in his tribe, until the time of his
    death!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>This story may be true, and it may not. I cannot contradict it; and I
    am sure the world will forgive me, if I say, I cannot believe it. If
    it be true, two things are also true; the one, not much to the credit
    of the Indian character; and the other, to the everlasting infamy of
    the Fur Traders. If it be true, it furnishes an instance of Indian
    depravity that I never have elsewhere heard of in my travels; and
    carries the most conclusive proof of the incredible enormity of white
    men’s dealings in this country; who, for some sinister purpose must
    have introduced the poisonous drug into the country, and taught the
    poor chief how to use it; whilst they were silent accessories to the
    murders he was committing. This story is said to have been told by the
    Fur Traders; and although I have not always the highest confidence in
    their justice to the Indian, yet, I cannot for the honour of my own
    species, believe them to be so depraved and so wicked, nor so weak, as
    to reveal such iniquities of this chief, if they were true, which must
    directly implicate themselves as accessories to his most wilful and
    unprovoked murders.</p>

  <p>Such he has been heralded, however, to future ages, as a murderer—like
    hundreds and thousands of others, as “horse thieves”—as “drunkards”—as
    “rogues of the first order,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—by the historian who catches but
    a glaring story, (and perhaps fabrication) of their lives, and has
    no time nor disposition to enquire into and record their long and
    brilliant list of virtues, which must be lost in the shade of infamy,
    for want of an historian.</p>

  <p>I have learned much of this noble chieftain, and at a proper time shall
    recount the modes of his civil and military life—how he exposed his
    life, and shed his blood in rescuing the victims to horrid torture,
    and abolished that savage custom in his tribe—-how he led on and
    headed his brave warriors, against the Sacs and Foxes; and saved the
    butchery of his women and children—how he received the Indian agent,
    and entertained him in his hospitable wigwam, in his village—and how he
    conducted and acquitted himself on his embassy to the civilized world.</p>

  <p>So much I will take pains to say, of a man whom I never saw, because
    other historians have taken equal pains just to mention his name, and a
    solitary (and doubtful) act of his life, as they have said of hundreds
    of others, for the purpose of consigning him to infamy.</p>

  <p>How much more kind would it have been for the historian, who never saw
    him, to have enumerated with this, other characteristic actions of his
    life (for the verdict of the world); or to have allowed, in charity,
    his bones and his name to have slept in silence, instead of calling
    them up from the grave, to thrust a dagger through them, and throw them
    back again.</p>

  <p>Book-making now-a-days, is done for money-making; and he who takes the
    Indian for his theme, and cannot go and see him, finds a poverty in
    his matter that naturally begets error, by grasping at every little
    tale that is brought or fabricated by their enemies. Such books are
    standards, because they are made for white man’s reading only; and
    herald the character of a people who never can disprove them. They
    answer the purpose for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> they are written; and the poor Indian who
    has no redress, stands stigmatized and branded, as a murderous wretch
    and beast.</p>

  <p>If the system of book-making and newspaper printing were in operation
    in the Indian country awhile, to herald the iniquities and horrible
    barbarities of white men in these Western regions, which now are
    sure to be overlooked; I venture to say, that chapters would soon be
    printed, which would sicken the reader to his heart, and set up the
    Indian, a fair and tolerable man.</p>

  <p>There is no more beautiful prairie country in the world, than that
    which is to be seen in this vicinity. In looking back from this bluff,
    towards the West, there is, to an almost boundless extent, one of
    the most beautiful scenes imaginable. The surface of the country is
    gracefully and slightly undulating, like the swells of the retiring
    ocean after a heavy storm. And everywhere covered with a beautiful
    green turf, and with occasional patches and clusters of trees. The soil
    in this region is also rich, and capable of making one of the most
    beautiful and productive countries in the world.</p>

  <p>Ba’tiste and Bogard used their rifles to some effect during the day
    that we loitered here, and gathered great quantities of delicious
    grapes. From this lovely spot we embarked the next morning, and glided
    through constantly changing scenes of beauty, until we landed our canoe
    at the base of a beautiful series of grass-covered bluffs, which, like
    thousands and thousands of others on the banks of this river, are
    designated by no name, that I know of; and I therefore introduce them
    as fair specimens of the <em>grassy bluffs</em> of the Missouri.</p>

  <p>My canoe was landed at noon, at the base of these picturesque hills—and
    there rested till the next morning. As soon as we were ashore, I
    scrambled to their summits, and beheld, even to a line, what the reader
    has before him in <span class="smcap">plates</span> 119 and 120. I took my easel, and
    canvass and brushes, to the top of the bluff, and painted the two
    views from the same spot; the one looking up, and the other down the
    river. The reader, by imagining these hills to be five or six hundred
    feet high, and every foot of them, as far as they can be discovered in
    distance, covered with a vivid green turf, whilst the sun is gilding
    one side, and throwing a cool shadow on the other, will be enabled to
    form something like an adequate idea of the shores of the Missouri.
    From this enchanting spot there was nothing to arrest the eye from
    ranging over its waters for the distance of twenty or thirty miles,
    where it quietly glides between its barriers, formed of thousands of
    green and gracefully sloping hills, with its rich and alluvial meadows,
    and woodlands—and its hundred islands, covered with stately cotton-wood.</p>

  <p>In these two views, the reader has a fair account of the general
    character of the Upper Missouri; and by turning back to <span class="smcap">plate 39,
    Vol. <abbr title="one">I.</abbr></span>, which I have already described, he will at once see the
    process by which this wonderful formation has been produced. In that
    plate will be seen the manner in which the rains are wearing down the
    clay-bluffs, cutting gullies or sluices behind them, and leaving them
    at last to stand out in relief, in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>these rounded and graceful forms,
    until in time they get seeded over, and nourish a growth of green
    grass on their sides, which forms a turf, and protects their surface,
    preserving them for centuries, in the forms that are here seen. The
    tops of the highest of these bluffs rise nearly up to the summit level
    of the prairies, which is found as soon as one travels a mile or so
    from the river, amongst these picturesque groups, and comes out at
    their top; from whence the country goes off to the East and the West,
    with an almost perfectly level surface.</p>

  <p>These two views were taken about thirty miles above the village of
    the Puncahs, and five miles above “the Tower;” the name given by the
    travellers through the country, to a high and remarkable clay bluff,
    rising to the height of some hundreds of feet from the water, and
    having in distance, the castellated appearance of a fortification.</p>

  <p>My canoe was not unmoored from the shores of this lovely spot for two
    days, except for the purpose of crossing the river; which I several
    times did, to ascend and examine the hills on the opposite side. I
    had Ba’tiste and Bogard with me on the tops of these green carpeted
    bluffs, and tried in vain to make them see the beauty of scenes that
    were about us. They dropped asleep, and I strolled and contemplated
    alone; clambering “<em>up one hill</em>” and sliding or running “<em>down
    another</em>,” with no other living being in sight, save now and then
    a bristling wolf, which, from my approach, was reluctantly retreating
    from his shady lair—or sneaking behind me and smelling on my track.</p>

  <p>Whilst strolling about on the western bank of the river at this place,
    I found the ancient site of an Indian village, which from the character
    of the marks, I am sure was once the residence of the Mandans. I said
    in a former Letter, when speaking of the Mandans, that within the
    recollection of some of their oldest men, they lived some sixty or
    eighty miles down the river from the place of their present residence;
    and that they then lived in nine villages. On my way down, I became
    fully convinced of the fact; having landed my canoe, and examined the
    ground where the foundation of every wigwam can yet be distinctly
    seen. At that time, they must have been much more numerous than at
    present, from the many marks they have left, as well as from their own
    representations.</p>

  <p>The Mandans have a peculiar way of building their wigwams, by digging
    down a couple of feet in the earth, and there fixing the ends of the
    poles which form the walls of their houses. There are other marks,
    such as their caches—and also their mode of depositing their dead on
    scaffolds—and of preserving the skulls in circles on the prairies;
    which peculiar customs I have before described, and most of which
    are distinctly to be recognized in each of these places, as well as
    in several similar remains which I have met with on the banks of the
    river, between here and the Mandans; which fully convince me, that
    they have formerly occupied the lower parts of the Missouri, and have
    gradually made their way quite through the heart of the great Sioux
    country; and having been well fortified in all their locations, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
    their present one, by a regular stockade and ditch; they have been
    able successfully to resist the continual assaults of the Sioux, that
    numerous tribe, who have been, and still are, endeavouring to effect
    their entire destruction. I have examined, at least fifteen or twenty
    of their ancient locations on the banks of this river, and can easily
    discover the regular differences in the ages of these antiquities; and
    around them all I have found numerous bits of their broken pottery,
    corresponding with that which they are now manufacturing in great
    abundance; and which is certainly made by no other tribe in these
    regions. These evidences, and others which I shall not take the time to
    mention in this place, go a great way in my mind towards strengthening
    the possibility of their having moved from the Ohio river, and of
    their being a remnant of the followers of Madoc. I have much further
    to trace them yet, however, and shall certainly have more to say on so
    interesting a subject in future.</p>

  <p>Almost every mile I have advanced on the banks of this river, I have
    met evidences and marks of Indians in some form or other; and they have
    generally been those of the Sioux, who occupy and own the greater part
    of this immense region of country. In the latter part of my voyage,
    however, and of which I have been speaking in the former part of this
    Letter, I met the ancient sites of the O-ma-ha and Ot-to towns, which
    are easily detected when they are met. In <a href="#i_121"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 121</a> (letter
    <span class="smcap">a</span>), is seen the usual mode of the Omahas, of depositing their
    dead in the crotches and on the branches of trees, enveloped in skins,
    and never without a wooden dish hanging by the head of the corpse;
    probably for the purpose of enabling it to dip up water to quench its
    thirst on the long and tedious journey, which they generally expect to
    enter on after death. These corpses are so frequent along the banks of
    the river, that in some places a dozen or more of them may be seen at
    one view.</p>

  <p>Letter <span class="smcap">b</span> in the same plate, shews the customs of the Sioux,
    which are found in endless numbers on the river; and in fact, through
    every part of this country. The wigwams of these people are only
    moveable tents, and leave but a temporary mark to be discovered. Their
    burials, however, are peculiar and lasting remains, which can be long
    detected. They often deposit their dead on trees, and on scaffolds; but
    more generally bury in the tops of bluffs, or near their villages; when
    they often split out staves and drive in the ground around the grave,
    to protect it from the trespass of dogs or wild animals.</p>

  <p>Letter <span class="smcap">c</span> (same plate), shews the character of Mandan remains,
    that are met with in numerous places on the river. Their mode of
    resting their dead upon scaffolds is not so peculiar to them as
    positively to distinguish them from Sioux, who sometimes bury in the
    same way; but the excavations for their earth-covered wigwams, which
    I have said are two feet deep in the ground, with the ends of the
    decayed timbers remaining in them, are peculiar and conclusive evidence
    of their being of Mandan construction; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>and the custom of leaving
    the skulls bleached upon the ground in circles (as I have formerly
    described in <span class="smcap">plate 48, Vol. <abbr title="one">I.</abbr></span>), instead of burying them as
    the other tribes do, forms also a strong evidence of the fact that they
    are Mandan remains.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>81</i></div>
  <figure id="i_121">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />

  </figure>

  <p>In most of these sites of their ancient towns, however, I have been
    unable to find about their burial places, these characteristic deposits
    of the skulls; from which I conclude, that whenever they deliberately
    moved to a different region, they buried the skulls out of respect to
    the dead. I found, just back of one of these sites of their ancient
    towns, however, and at least 500 miles below where they now live, the
    same arrangement of skulls as that I described in <span class="smcap">plate</span> 48.
    They had laid so long, however, exposed to the weather, that they were
    reduced almost to a powder, except the teeth, which mostly seemed
    polished and sound as ever. It seems that no human hands had dared to
    meddle with the dead; and that even their enemies had respected them;
    for every one, and there were at least two hundred in one circle, had
    mouldered to chalk, in its exact relative position, as they had been
    placed in a circle. In this case, I am of opinion that the village was
    besieged by the Sioux, and entirely destroyed; or that the Mandans were
    driven off without the power to stop and bury the bones of their dead.</p>

  <p><em>Belle Vue</em> (<a href="#i_122"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 122</a>) is a lovely scene on the West
    bank of the river, about nine miles above the mouth of the Platte, and
    is the agency of Major Dougherty, one of the oldest and most effective
    agents on our frontiers. This spot is, as I said, lovely in itself;
    but doubly so to the eye of the weather-beaten <em>voyageur</em> from
    the sources of the Missouri, who steers his canoe in, to the shore,
    as I did, and soon finds himself a welcome guest at the comfortable
    board of the Major, with a table again to eat from—and that (not
    “<em>groaning</em>,” but) <em>standing</em> under the comfortable weight of
    meat and vegetable luxuries, products of the labour of cultivating man.
    It was a pleasure to see again, in this great wilderness, a civilized
    habitation; and still more pleasant to find it surrounded with
    corn-fields, and potatoes, with numerous fruit-trees, bending under the
    weight of their fruit—with pigs and poultry, and kine; and what was
    best of all, to see the kind and benevolent face, that never looked
    anything but welcome to the half-starved guests, who throw themselves
    upon him from the North, from the South, the East, or the West.</p>

  <p>At this place I was in the country of the Pawnees, a numerous tribe,
    whose villages are on the Platte river, and of whom I shall say more
    anon. Major Dougherty has been for many years the agent for this
    hostile tribe; and by his familiar knowledge of the Indian character,
    and his strict honesty and integrity, he has been able to effect a
    friendly intercourse with them, and also to attract the applause and
    highest confidence of the world, as well as of the authorities who sent
    him there.</p>

  <p>An hundred miles above this, I passed a curious feature, called the
    “Square Hills” (<a href="#i_123"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 123</a>). I landed my canoe, and went
    ashore, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> to their tops, to examine them. Though they appeared
    to be near the river, I found it half a day’s journey to travel to
    and from them; they being several miles from the river. On ascending
    them I found them to be two or three hundred feet high, and rising
    on their sides at an angle of 45 degrees; and on their tops, in some
    places, for half a mile in length, perfectly level, with a green turf,
    and corresponding exactly with the tabular hills spoken of above the
    Mandans, in <span class="smcap">plate 39, Vol. <abbr title="one">I.</abbr></span> I therein said, that I should
    visit these hills on my way down the river; and I am fully convinced,
    from close examination, that they are a part of the same original
    superstratum, which I therein described, though seven or eight hundred
    miles separated from them. They agree exactly in character, and also
    in the materials of which they are composed; and I believe, that some
    unaccountable gorge of waters has swept away the intervening earth,
    leaving these solitary and isolated, though incontrovertible evidences,
    that the summit level of all this great valley has at one time been
    where the level surface of these hills now is, two or three hundred
    feet above what is now generally denominated the summit level.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the Platte (<a href="#i_124"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 124</a>), is a beautiful scene,
    and no doubt will be the site of a large and flourishing town, soon
    after Indian titles shall have been extinguished to the lands in these
    regions, which will be done within a very few years. The Platte is
    a long and powerful stream, pouring in from the Rocky Mountains and
    joining with the Missouri at this place.</p>

  <p>In this voyage, as in all others that I have performed, I kept my
    journal, but I have not room, it will be seen, to insert more than an
    occasional extract from it for my present purpose. In this voyage,
    Ba’tiste and Bogard were my constant companions; and we all had our
    rifles, and used them often. We often went ashore amongst the herds of
    buffaloes, and were obliged to do so for our daily food. We lived the
    whole way on buffaloes’ flesh and venison—we had no bread; but laid in
    a good stock of coffee and sugar. These, however, from an unforeseen
    accident availed us but little; as on the second or third day of our
    voyage, after we had taken our coffee on the shore, and Ba’tiste and
    Bogard had gone in pursuit of a herd of buffaloes, I took it in my
    head to have an extra very fine dish of coffee to myself, as the fire
    was fine. For this purpose, I added more coffee-grounds to the pot,
    and placed it on the fire, which I sat watching, when I saw a fine
    buffalo cow wending her way leisurely over the hills, but a little
    distance from me, for whom I started at once, with my rifle trailed
    in my hand; and after creeping, and running, and heading, and all
    that, for half an hour, without getting a shot at her; I came back to
    the encampment, where I found my two men with meat enough, but in the
    most uncontroulable rage, for my coffee had all boiled out, and the
    coffee-pot was melted to pieces!</p>

  <p>This was truly a deplorable accident, and one that could in no
    effectual way be remedied. We afterwards botched up a mess or two of
    it in our frying-pan, but to little purpose, and then abandoned it to
    Bogard alone, who thankfully <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>received the dry coffee-grounds and
    sugar, at his meals, which he soon entirely demolished.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>82</i></div>

  <p>We met immense numbers of buffaloes in the early part of our voyage and
    used to land our canoe almost every hour in the day; and oftentimes all
    together approach the unsuspecting herds, through some deep and hidden
    ravine within a few rods of them, and at the word, “pull trigger,” each
    of us bring down our victim (<a href="#i_125"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 125</a>).</p>

  <p>In one instance, near the mouth of White River, we met the most immense
    herd crossing the Missouri River—and from an imprudence got our boat
    into imminent danger amongst them, from which we were highly delighted
    to make our escape. It was in the midst of the “running season,” and
    we had heard the “roaring” (as it is called) of the herd, when we
    were several miles from them. When we came in sight, we were actually
    terrified at the immense numbers that were streaming down the green
    hills on one side of the river, and galloping up and over the bluffs
    on the other. The river was filled, and in parts blackened, with their
    heads and horns, as they were swimming about, following up their
    objects, and making desperate battle whilst they were swimming.</p>

  <p>I deemed it imprudent for our canoe to be dodging amongst them,
    and ran it ashore for a few hours, where we laid, waiting for the
    opportunity of seeing the river clear; but we waited in vain. Their
    numbers, however, got somewhat diminished at last, and we pushed off,
    and successfully made our way amongst them. From the immense numbers
    that had passed the river at that place, they had torn down the prairie
    bank of fifteen feet in height, so as to form a sort of road or
    landing-place, where they all in succession clambered up. Many in their
    turmoil had been wafted below this landing, and unable to regain it
    against the swiftness of the current, had fastened themselves along in
    crowds, hugging close to the high bank under which they were standing.
    As we were drifting by these, and supposing ourselves out of danger, I
    drew up my rifle and shot one of them in the head, which tumbled into
    the water, and brought with him a hundred others, which plunged in,
    and in a moment were swimming about our canoe, and placing it in great
    danger (<a href="#i_126"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 126</a>). No attack was made upon us, and in the
    confusion the poor beasts knew not, perhaps, the enemy that was amongst
    them; but we were liable to be sunk by them, as they were furiously
    hooking and climbing on to each other. I rose in my canoe, and by my
    gestures and hallooing, kept them from coming in contact with us, until
    we were out of their reach.</p>

  <p>This was one of the instances that I formerly spoke of, where thousands
    and tens of thousands of these animals congregate in the <em>running
    season</em>, and move about from East and West, or wherever accident or
    circumstances may lead them. In this grand crusade, no one can know the
    numbers that may have made the ford within a few days; nor in their
    blinded fury in such scenes, would feeble man be much respected.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>During the remainder of that day we paddled onward, and passed many
    of their carcasses floating on the current, or lodged on the heads of
    islands and sand-bars. And, in the vicinity of, and not far below the
    grand turmoil, we passed several that were mired in the quicksand near
    the shores; some were standing fast and half immersed; whilst others
    were nearly out of sight, and gasping for the last breath; others were
    standing with all legs fast, and one half of their bodies above the
    water, and their heads sunk under it, where they had evidently remained
    several days; and flocks of ravens and crows were covering their backs,
    and picking the flesh from their dead bodies.</p>

  <p>So much of the Upper Missouri and its modes, at present; though I have
    much more in store for some future occasion.</p>

  <p>Fort Leavenworth, which is on the Lower Missouri, being below the mouth
    of the Platte, is the nucleus of another neighbourhood of Indians,
    amongst whom I am to commence my labours, and of whom I shall soon be
    enabled to give some account. So, for the present, Adieu.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT LEAVENWORTH, <i>LOWER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">I mentioned</span> in a former epistle, that this is the extreme outpost on
    the Western Frontier, and built, like several others, in the heart of
    the Indian country. There is no finer tract of lands in North America,
    or, perhaps, in the world, than that vast space of prairie country,
    which lies in the vicinity of this post, embracing it on all sides.
    This garrison, like many others on the frontiers, is avowedly placed
    here for the purpose of protecting our frontier inhabitants from the
    incursions of Indians; and also for the purpose of preserving the peace
    amongst the different hostile tribes, who seem continually to wage, and
    glory in, their deadly wars. How far these feeble garrisons, which are
    generally but half manned, have been, or will be, able to intimidate
    and controul the warlike ardour of these restless and revengeful
    spirits; or how far they will be able in desperate necessity, to
    protect the lives and property of the honest pioneer, is yet to be
    tested.</p>

  <p>They have doubtless been designed with the best views, to effect the
    most humane objects, though I very much doubt the benefits that are
    anticipated to flow from them, unless a more efficient number of men
    are stationed in them than I have generally found; enough to promise
    protection to the Indian, and then to <em>ensure</em> it; instead of
    promising, and leaving them to seek it in their own way at last, and
    when they are least prepared to do it.</p>

  <p>When I speak of this post as being on the <em>Lower Missouri</em>, I do
    not wish to convey the idea that I am down near the sea-coast, at the
    mouth of the river, or near it; I only mean that I am on the lower part
    of the Missouri, yet 600 miles above its junction with the Mississippi,
    and near 2000 from the Gulf of Mexico, into which the Mississippi
    discharges its waters.</p>

  <p>In this delightful Cantonment there are generally stationed six or
    seven companies of infantry, and ten or fifteen officers; several
    of whom have their wives and daughters with them, forming a very
    pleasant little community, who are almost continually together in
    social enjoyment of the peculiar amusements and pleasures of this
    wild country. Of these pastimes they have many, such as riding on
    horseback or in carriages over the beautiful green fields of the
    prairies, picking strawberries and wild plums—deer chasing—grouse
    shooting—horse-racing, and other amusements of the garrison, in which
    they are almost constantly engaged; enjoying life to a very high
    degree.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>In these delightful amusements, and with these pleasing companions, I
    have been for a while participating with great satisfaction; I have
    joined several times in the deer-hunts, and more frequently in grouse
    shooting, which constitutes the principal amusement of this place.</p>

  <p>This delicious bird, which is found in great abundance in nearly all
    the North American prairies, and most generally called the Prairie Hen,
    is, from what I can learn, very much like the English grouse, or heath
    hen, both in size, in colour, and in habits. They make their appearance
    in these parts in the months of August and September, from the higher
    latitudes, where they go in the early part of the summer, to raise
    their broods. This is the season for the best sport amongst them; and
    the whole garrison, in fact are almost subsisted on them at this time,
    owing to the facility with which they are killed.</p>

  <p>I was lucky enough the other day, with one of the officers of the
    garrison, to gain the enviable distinction of having brought in
    together seventy-five of these fine birds, which we killed in one
    afternoon; and although I am quite ashamed to confess the manner in
    which we killed the greater part of them, I am not so professed a
    sportsman as to induce me to conceal the fact. We had a fine pointer,
    and had legitimately followed the sportsman’s style for a part of the
    afternoon; but seeing the prairies on fire several miles ahead of us,
    and the wind driving the fire gradually towards us, we found these
    poor birds driven before its long line, which seemed to extend from
    horizon to horizon, and they were flying in swarms or flocks that
    would at times almost fill the air. They generally flew half a mile or
    so, and lit down again in the grass, where they would sit until the
    fire was close upon them, and then they would rise again. We observed
    by watching their motions, that they lit in great numbers in every
    solitary tree; and we placed ourselves near each of these trees in
    turn, and shot them down as they settled in them; sometimes killing
    five or six at a shot, by getting a range upon them.</p>

  <p>In this way we retreated for miles before the flames, in the midst of
    the flocks, and keeping company with them where they were carried along
    in advance of the fire, in accumulating numbers; many of which had been
    driven along for many miles. We murdered the poor birds in this way,
    until we had as many as we could well carry, and laid our course back
    to the Fort, where we got much credit for our great shooting, and where
    we were mutually pledged to keep the secret.</p>

  <p>The prairies burning form some of the most beautiful scenes that are to
    be witnessed in this country, and also some of the most sublime. Every
    acre of these vast prairies (being covered for hundreds and hundreds of
    miles, with a crop of grass, which dies and dries in the fall) burns
    over during the fall or early in the spring, leaving the ground of a
    black and doleful colour.</p>

  <p>There are many modes by which the fire is communicated to them, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
    by white men and by Indians—<em>par accident</em>; and yet many more
    where it is voluntarily done for the purpose of getting a fresh crop of
    grass, for the grazing of their horses, and also for easier travelling
    during the next summer, when there will be no old grass to lie upon the
    prairies, entangling the feet of man and horse, as they are passing
    over them.</p>

  <p>Over the elevated lands and prairie bluffs, where the grass is thin
    and short, the fire slowly creeps with a feeble flame, which one can
    easily step over (<a href="#i_127"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 127</a>); where the wild animals often
    rest in their lairs until the flames almost burn their noses, when
    they will reluctantly rise, and leap over it, and trot off amongst the
    cinders, where the fire has past and left the ground as black as jet.
    These scenes at night become indescribably beautiful, when their flames
    are seen at many miles distance, creeping over the sides and tops of
    the bluffs, appearing to be sparkling and brilliant chains of liquid
    fire (the hills being lost to the view), hanging suspended in graceful
    festoons from the skies.</p>

  <p>But there is yet another character of burning prairies (<a href="#i_128"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    128</a>), that requires another Letter, and a different pen to describe—the
    war, or hell of fires! where the grass is seven or eight feet high, as
    is often the case for many miles together, on the Missouri bottoms;
    and the flames are driven forward by the hurricanes, which often sweep
    over the vast prairies of this denuded country. There are many of
    these meadows on the Missouri, the Platte, and the Arkansas, of many
    miles in breadth, which are perfectly level, with a waving grass, so
    high, that we are obliged to stand erect in our stirrups, in order to
    look over its waving tops, as we are riding through it. The fire in
    these, before such a wind, travels at an immense and frightful rate,
    and often destroys, on their fleetest horses, parties of Indians,
    who are so unlucky as to be overtaken by it; not that it travels as
    fast as a horse at full speed, but that the high grass is filled with
    wild pea-vines and other impediments, which render it necessary for
    the rider to guide his horse in the zig-zag paths of the deers and
    buffaloes, retarding his progress, until he is overtaken by the dense
    column of smoke that is swept before the fire—alarming the horse, which
    stops and stands terrified and immutable, till the burning grass which
    is wafted in the wind, falls about him, kindling up in a moment a
    thousand new fires, which are instantly wrapped in the swelling flood
    of smoke that is moving on like a black thunder-cloud, rolling on the
    earth, with its lightning’s glare, and its thunder rumbling as it goes.
    <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * *</span>
    When Ba’tiste, and Bogard, and I, and Patrick Raymond (who like Bogard
    had been a free trapper in the Rocky Mountains), and Pah-me-o-ne-qua
    (the red thunder), our guide back from a neighbouring village, were
    jogging along on the summit of an elevated bluff, overlooking an
    immense valley of high grass, through which we were about to lay our
    course.—— <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * * *</span></p>

  <p>“Well, then, you say you have seen the prairies on fire?” Yes. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
    have seen the fire on the mountains, and beheld it feebly creeping over
    the grassy hills of the North, where the toad and the timid snail were
    pacing from its approach—all this you have seen, and who has not? But
    who has seen the vivid lightnings, and heard the roaring thunder of the
    rolling conflagration which sweeps over the <em>deep-clad</em> prairies
    of the West? Who has dashed, on his wild horse, through an ocean of
    grass, with the raging tempest at his back, rolling over the land
    its swelling waves of liquid fire?” What! “Aye, even so. Ask the red
    savage of the wilds what is awful and sublime—Ask him where the Great
    Spirit has mixed up all the elements of death, and if he does not blow
    them over the land in a storm of fire? Ask him what foe he has met,
    that regarded not his frightening yells, or his sinewy bow? Ask these
    lords of the land, who vauntingly challenge the thunder and lightning
    of Heaven—whether there is not one foe that travels over their land,
    too swift for their feet, and too mighty for their strength—at whose
    approach their stout hearts sicken, and their strong-armed courage
    withers to nothing? Ask him <em>again</em> (if he is sullen, and his eyes
    set in their sockets)—‘Hush!———sh!———sh!’—(he will tell you, with a
    soul too proud to confess—his head sunk on his breast, and his hand
    over his mouth)—‘that’s <em>medicine</em>!’” <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * * * * * *</span></p>

  <p>I said to my comrades, as we were about to descend from the towering
    bluffs into the prairie—“We will take that buffalo trail, where the
    travelling herds have slashed down the high grass, and making for that
    blue point, rising, as you can just discern, above this ocean of grass;
    a good day’s work will bring us over this vast meadow before sunset.”
    We entered the trail, and slowly progressed on our way, being obliged
    to follow the winding paths of the buffaloes, for the grass was higher
    than the backs of our horses. Soon after we entered, my Indian guide
    dismounted slowly from his horse, and lying prostrate on the ground,
    with his face in the dirt, he <em>cried</em>, and was talking to the
    Spirits of the brave—“For,” said he, “over this beautiful plain dwells
    the Spirit of fire! he rides in yonder cloud—his face blackens with
    rage at the sound of the trampling hoofs—the <em>fire-bow</em> is in
    his hand—he draws it across the path of the Indian, and quicker than
    lightning, a thousand flames rise to destroy him; such is the talk of
    my fathers, and the ground is whitened with their bones. It was here,”
    said he, “that the brave son of Wah-chee-ton, and the strong-armed
    warriors of his band, just twelve moons since, licked the fire from
    the blazing wand of that great magician. Their pointed spears were
    drawn upon the backs of the treacherous Sioux, whose swifter-flying
    horses led them, in vain, to the midst of this valley of death. A
    circular cloud sprang up from the prairie around them! it was raised,
    and their doom was fixed by the Spirit of fire! It was on this vast
    plain of <em>fire-grass</em> that waves over our heads, that the swift
    foot of Mah-to-ga was laid. It is here, also, that the fleet-bounding
    wild horse mingles his bones with the red man; and the eagle’s wing is
    melted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>as he darts over its surface. Friends! it is the season of
    fire; and I fear, from the smell of the wind, that the Spirit is awake!”</p>

  <p>Pah-me-o-ne-qua said no more, but mounted his wild horse, and waving
    his hand, his red shoulders were seen rapidly vanishing as he glided
    through the thick mazes of waving grass. We were on his trail, and
    busily traced him until the midday-sun had brought us to the ground,
    with our refreshments spread before us. He partook of them not, but
    stood like a statue, while his black eyes, in sullen silence, swept
    the horizon round; and then, with a deep-drawn sigh, he gracefully
    sunk to the earth, and laid with his face to the ground. Our buffalo
    <em>tongues</em> and pemican, and marrow-fat, were spread before us; and
    we were in the full enjoyment of these dainties of the Western world,
    when, quicker than the frightened elk, our Indian friend sprang upon
    his feet! His eyes skimmed again slowly over the prairies’ surface, and
    he laid himself as before on the ground.</p>

  <p>“Red Thunder seems sullen to-day,” said Bogard—“he startles at every
    rush of the wind, and scowls at the whole world that is about him.”</p>

  <p>“There’s a rare chap for you—a fellow who would shake his fist at
    Heaven, when he is at home; and here, in a <em>grass-patch</em>, must
    make his <em>fire-medicine</em> for a <em>circumstance</em> that he could
    easily leave at a shake of his horse’s heels.”</p>

  <p>“Not sae sure o’ that, my hooney, though we’ll not be making too
    lightly of the matter, nor either be frightened at the mon’s strange
    octions. But, Bogard, I’ll tell ye in a ’ord (and thot’s enough),
    there’s something more than odds in all this ‘<em>medicine</em>.’ If this
    mon’s a fool, he was born out of his own country, that’s all—and if the
    divil iver gits him, he must take him cowld, for he is too swift and
    too wide-awake to be taken alive—you understond thot, I suppouse? But,
    to come to the plain matter—supposin that the Fire Spirit (and I go for
    somewhat of witchcraft), I say supposin that this <em>Fire Spirit</em>
    should jist impty his pipe on tother side of this prairie, and strike
    up a bit of a blaze in this high grass, and send it packing across
    in this direction, before sich a death of a wind as this is! By the
    <em>bull barley</em>, I’ll bet you’d be after ‘<em>making medicine</em>,’
    and taking a bit of it, too, to get rid of the racket.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, but you see, Patrick——”</p>

  <p>“Neever mind thot (not wishin to distarb you); and suppouse the blowin
    wind was coming fast ahead, jist blowin about our ears a warld of
    smoke and chokin us to dith, and we were dancin about a <em>Varginny
    reel</em> among these little paths, where the divil would we be by the
    time we got to that bluff, for it’s now fool of a distance? Givin you
    time to spake, I would say a word more (askin your pardon), I know by
    the expression of your face, mon, you neever have seen the world on
    fire yet, and therefore you know nothin at all of a <em>hurly burly</em>
    of this kind—did ye?—did ye iver see (and I jist want to know), did
    ye iver see the fire in high-grass, runnin with a strong wind, about
    five mile and the half, and thin hear it strike into a <em>slash</em>
    of <em>dry</em> cane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> brake!! I would jist ax you that? By thuneder you
    niver have—for your eyes would jist stick out of your head at the
    thought of it! Did ye iver look way into the backside of Mr. Maelzel’s
    Moscow, and see the flashin flames a runnin up; and then hear the
    poppin of the <em>militia fire</em> jist afterwards? then you have jist
    a touch of it! ye’re jist beginnin—ye may talk about fires—but this is
    sich a <em>baste of a fire</em>! Ask <em>Jack Sanford</em>, he’s a chop
    that can tall you all aboot it. Not wishin to distarb you, I would say
    a word more—and that is this—If I were advisin, I would say that we
    are gettin too far into this imbustible meadow; for the grass is dry,
    and the wind is too strong to make a light matter of, at this sason of
    the year; an now I’ll jist tell ye how M‘Kenzie and I were sarved in
    this very place about two years ago; and he’s a worldly chop, and niver
    aslape, my word for that———hollo, what’s that!”</p>

  <p><em>Red Thunder</em> was on his feet!—his long arm was stretched over
    the grass, and his blazing eye-balls starting from their sockets!
    “White man (said he), see ye that small cloud lifting itself from
    the prairie? he rises! the hoofs of our horses have waked him! The
    <em>Fire Spirit</em> is awake—this wind is from his nostrils, and his
    face is this way!” No more—but his swift horse darted under him, and
    he gracefully slid over the waving grass as it was bent by the wind.
    Our viands were left, and we were swift on his trail. The extraordinary
    leaps of his wild horse, occasionally raised his red shoulders to view,
    and he sank again in the waving billows of grass. The tremulous wind
    was hurrying by us fast, and on it was borne the agitated wing of the
    soaring eagle. His neck was stretched for the towering bluff, and the
    thrilling screams of his voice told the secret that was behind him.
    Our horses were swift, and we struggled hard, yet hope was feeble,
    for the bluff was yet <em>blue</em>, and nature nearly exhausted! The
    sunshine was <em>dying</em>, and a cool shadow advancing over the plain.
    Not daring to look back, we strained every nerve. The roar of a
    distant cataract seemed gradually advancing on us—the winds increased,
    the howling tempest was maddening behind us—and the swift-winged
    <em>beetle</em> and <em>heath hens</em>, instinctively drew their straight
    lines over our heads. The fleet-bounding antelope passed us also; and
    the <em>still swifter</em> long-legged hare, who leaves but a shadow as
    he flies! Here was no time for thought—but I recollect the heavens
    were overcast—the distant thunder was heard—the lightning’s glare was
    reddening the scene—and the smell that came on the winds struck terror
    to my soul! <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * *</span> The piercing yell of my savage guide at this moment
    came back upon the winds—his robe was seen waving in the air, and his
    foaming horse leaping up the towering bluff.</p>

  <p>Our breath and our sinews, in this last struggle for life, were just
    enough to bring us to its summit. We had risen from a <em>sea of
    fire</em>! “Great God! (I exclaimed) how sublime to gaze into that
    valley, where the elements of nature are so strangely convulsed!” Ask
    not the poet or painter how it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> looked, for they can tell you not; but
    ask the <em>naked savage</em>, and watch the electric twinge of his manly
    nerves and muscles, as he pronounces the lengthened “hush——sh———” his
    hand on his mouth, and his glaring eye-balls looking you to the very
    soul!</p>

  <p>I beheld beneath me an immense cloud of black smoke, which extended
    from one extremity of this vast plain to the other, and seemed
    majestically to roll over its surface in a bed of liquid fire; and
    above this mighty desolation, as it rolled along, the whitened smoke,
    pale with terror, was streaming and rising up in magnificent cliffs to
    heaven!</p>

  <p>I stood <em>secure</em>, but tremblingly, and heard the maddening wind,
    which hurled this <em>monster</em> o’er the land—I heard the roaring
    thunder, and saw its thousand lightnings flash; and then I saw
    <em>behind</em>, the black and smoking desolation of this <em>storm</em> of
    <em>fire</em>!</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT LEAVENWORTH, <i>LOWER MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> writing the last epistle, some considerable time has elapsed,
    which has, nevertheless, been filled up and used to advantage,
    as I have been moving about and using my brush amongst different
    tribes in this vicinity. The Indians that may be said to belong
    to this vicinity, and who constantly visit this post, are the
    Ioways—Konzas—Pawnees—Omahas—Ottoes, and Missouries (primitive), and
    Delawares—Kickapoos—Potawatomies—Weahs—Peorias—Shawanos, Kaskaskias
    (semi-civilized remnants of tribes that have been removed to this
    neighbourhood by the Government, within the few years past). These
    latter-named tribes are, to a considerable degree, agriculturalists;
    getting their living principally by ploughing, and raising corn, and
    cattle and horses. They have been left on the frontier, surrounded by
    civilized neighbours, where they have at length been induced to sell
    out their lands, or exchange them for a much larger tract of wild lands
    in these regions, which the Government has purchased from the wilder
    tribes.</p>

  <p>Of the first named, the Ioways may be said to be the farthest
    departed from primitive modes, as they are depending chiefly on their
    corn-fields for subsistence; though their appearance, both in their
    dwellings and personal looks, dress, modes, &amp;c., is that of the
    primitive Indian.</p>

  <p>The Ioways are a small tribe, of about fourteen hundred persons, living
    in a snug little village within a few miles of the eastern bank of the
    Missouri River, a few miles above this place.</p>

  <p>The present chief of this tribe is Notch-ee-ning-a (the white cloud,
    <a href="#i_129"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 129</a>), the son of a very distinguished chief of the same
    name, who died recently, after gaining the love of his tribe, and
    the respect of all the civilized world who knew him. If my time and
    space will admit it, and I should not forget it, I shall take another
    occasion to detail some of the famous transactions of his signal life.</p>

  <p>The son of White Cloud, who is now chief, and whose portrait I have
    just named, was tastefully dressed with a buffalo robe, wrapped around
    him, with a necklace of grizzly bear’s claws on his neck; with shield,
    bow, and quiver on, and a profusion of wampum strings on his neck.</p>

  <p><em>Wy-ee-yogh</em> (the man of sense, <a href="#i_129"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 130</a>), is another
    of this tribe, much distinguished for his bravery and early warlike
    achievements. His head was dressed with a broad silver band passing
    around it, and decked out with the crest of horsehair.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

  <p>Pah-ta-coo-che (the shooting cedar, <a href="#i_131"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 131</a>), and
    Was-com-mun (the busy man, <a href="#i_131"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 132</a>), are also distinguished
    warriors of the tribe; tastefully dressed and equipped, the one with
    his war-club on his arm, the other with bow and arrows in his hand;
    both wore around their waists beautiful buffalo robes, and both had
    turbans made of vari-coloured cotton shawls, purchased of the Fur
    Traders. Around their necks were necklaces of the bears’ claws, and a
    profusion of beads and wampum. Their ears were profusely strung with
    beads; and their naked shoulders curiously streaked and daubed with red
    paint.</p>

  <p>Others of this tribe will be found amongst the paintings in my Indian
    Museum; and more of them and their customs given at a future time.</p>

  <p>The Konzas, of 1560 souls, reside at the distance of sixty or eighty
    miles from this place, on the Konzas River, fifty miles above its union
    with the Missouri, from the West.</p>

  <p>This tribe has undoubtedly sprung from the Osages, as their personal
    appearance, language and traditions clearly prove. They are living
    adjoining to the Osages at this time, and although a kindred people,
    have sometimes deadly warfare with them. The present chief of this
    tribe is known by the name of the “White Plume;” a very urbane and
    hospitable man, of good portly size, speaking some English, and making
    himself good company for all white persons who travel through his
    country and have the good luck to shake his liberal and hospitable hand.</p>

  <p>It has been to me a source of much regret, that I did not get the
    portrait of this celebrated chief; but I have painted several others
    distinguished in the tribe, which are fair specimens of these people.
    Sho-me-cos-se (the wolf, <a href="#i_133"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 133</a>), a chief of some
    distinction, with a bold and manly outline of head; exhibiting, like
    most of this tribe, an European outline of features, signally worthy
    the notice of the enquiring world. The head of this chief was most
    curiously ornamented, and his neck bore a profusion of wampum strings.</p>

  <p>Meach-o-shin-gaw (the little white bear, <a href="#i_133"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 134</a>).
    Chesh-oo-hong-ha (the man of good sense, <a href="#i_135"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 135</a>), and
    Wa-hon-ga-shee (no fool, <a href="#i_135"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 136</a>), are portraits of
    distinguished Konzas, and all furnish striking instances of the bold
    and Roman outline that I have just spoken of.</p>

  <p>The custom of shaving the head, and ornamenting it with the crest
    of deer’s hair, belongs to this tribe; and also to the Osages, the
    Pawnees, the Sacs, and Foxes, and Ioways, and to no other tribe that
    I know of; unless it be in some few instances, where individuals have
    introduced it into their tribes, merely by way of imitation.</p>

  <p>With these tribes, the custom is one uniformly adhered to by every man
    in the nation; excepting some few instances along the frontier, where
    efforts are made to imitate white men, by allowing the hair to grow out.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_135"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 135</a>, is a fair exhibition of this very curious
    custom—the hair being cut as close to the head as possible, except a
    tuft the size of the palm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> of the hand, on the crown of the head, which
    is left of two inches in length: and in the centre of which is fastened
    a beautiful crest made of the hair of the deer’s tail (dyed red) and
    horsehair, and oftentimes surmounted with the war-eagle’s quill. In
    the centre of the patch of hair, which I said was left of a couple
    of inches in length, is preserved a small lock, which is never cut,
    but cultivated to the greatest length possible, and uniformly kept in
    braid, and passed through a piece of curiously carved bone; which lies
    in the centre of the crest, and spreads it out to its uniform shape,
    which they study with great care to preserve. Through this little
    braid, and outside of the bone, passes a small wooden or bone key,
    which holds the crest to the head. This little braid is called in these
    tribes, the “<em>scalp-lock</em>,” and is scrupulously preserved in this
    way, and offered to their enemy if they can get it, as a trophy; which
    it seems in all tribes they are anxious to yield to their conquerors,
    in case they are killed in battle; and which it would be considered
    cowardly and disgraceful for a warrior to shave off, leaving nothing
    for his enemy to grasp for, when he falls into his hands in the events
    of battle.</p>

  <p>Amongst those tribes who thus shave and ornament their heads, the crest
    is uniformly blood-red; and the upper part of the head, and generally
    a considerable part of the face, as red as they can possibly make it
    with vermilion. I found these people cutting off the hair with small
    scissors, which they purchase of the Fur Traders; and they told me that
    previous to getting scissors, they cut it away with their knives; and
    before they got knives, they were in the habit of burning it off with
    red hot stones, which was a very slow and painful operation.</p>

  <p>With the exception of these few, all the other tribes in North America
    cultivate the hair to the greatest length they possibly can; preserving
    it to flow over their shoulders and backs in great profusion, and quite
    unwilling to spare the smallest lock of it for any consideration.</p>

  <p>The Pawnees are a very powerful and warlike nation, living on the river
    Platte, about one hundred miles from its junction with the Missouri;
    laying claim to, and exercising sway over, the whole country, from its
    mouth to the base of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>The present number of this tribe is ten or twelve thousand; about one
    half the number they had in 1832, when that most appalling disease, the
    small-pox, was accidentally introduced amongst them by the Fur Traders,
    and whiskey sellers; when ten thousand (or more) of them perished in
    the course of a few months.</p>

  <p>The Omahas, of fifteen hundred; the Ottoes of six hundred; and
    Missouries of four hundred, who are now living under the protection and
    surveillance of the Pawnees, and in the immediate vicinity of them,
    were all powerful tribes, but so reduced by this frightful disease,
    and at the same time, that they were unable longer to stand against
    so formidable enemies as they had around them, in the Sioux, Pawnees,
    Sacs, and Foxes, and at last <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>merged into the Pawnee tribe, under
    whose wing and protection they now live.</p>

  <p>The period of this awful calamity in these regions, was one that will
    be long felt, and long preserved in the traditions of these people. The
    great tribe of the Sioux, of whom I have heretofore spoken, suffered
    severely with the same disease; as well as the Osages and Konzas; and
    particularly the unfortunate Puncahs, who were almost extinguished by
    it.</p>

  <p>The destructive ravages of this most fatal disease amongst these poor
    people, who know of no specific for it, is beyond the knowledge, and
    almost beyond the belief, of the civilized world. Terror and dismay
    are carried with it; and awful despair, in the midst of which they
    plunge into the river, when in the highest state of fever, and die in a
    moment; or dash themselves from precipices; or plunge their knives to
    their hearts, to rid themselves from the pangs of slow and disgusting
    death.</p>

  <p>Amongst the formidable tribe of Pawnees, the Fur Traders are yet doing
    some business; but, from what I can learn, the Indians are dealing
    with some considerable distrust, with a people who introduced so fatal
    a calamity amongst them, to which one half of their tribe have fallen
    victims. The Traders made their richest harvest amongst these people,
    before this disease broke out; and since it subsided, quite a number
    of their lives have paid the forfeit, according to the Indian laws of
    retribution.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>The Pawnees have ever been looked upon, as a very warlike and hostile
    tribe; and unusually so, since the calamity which I have mentioned.</p>

  <p>Major Dougherty, of whom I have heretofore spoken, has been for
    several <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>years their agent; and by his unremitted endeavours, with
    an unequalled familiarity with the Indian character, and unyielding
    integrity of purpose, has successfully restored and established,
    a system of good feeling and respect between them and the “pale
    faces,” upon whom they looked, naturally and experimentally, as their
    destructive enemies.</p>

  <p>Of this stern and uncompromising friend of the red man, and of justice,
    who has taken them close to his heart, and familiarized himself with
    their faults and their griefs, I take great pleasure in recording here
    for the perusal of the world, the following extract from one of his
    true and independent Reports, to the Secretary at War; which sheds
    honour on his name, and deserves a more public place than the mere
    official archives of a Government record.</p>

  <p>“In comparing this Report with those of the years preceding, you will
    find there has been little improvement on the part of the Indians,
    either in literary acquirements or in agricultural knowledge.</p>

  <p>“It is my decided opinion, that, so long as the Fur Traders and
    trappers are permitted to reside among the Indians, all the efforts
    of the Government to better their condition will be fruitless; or, in
    a great measure checked by the strong influence of those men over the
    various tribes.</p>

  <p>“Every exertion of the agents, (and other persons, intended to carry
    into effect the views of the Government, and humane societies,) are
    in such direct opposition to the Trader and his interest, that the
    agent finds himself continually contending with, and placed in direct
    and immediate contrariety of interest to the Fur Traders or grossly
    neglecting his duty by overlooking acts of impropriety; and it is a
    curious and melancholy fact, that while the General Government is using
    every means and expense to promote the advancement of those aboriginal
    people, it is at the same time suffering the Traders to oppose and
    defeat the very objects of its intentions. So long as the Traders and
    trappers are permitted in the Indian country, the introduction of
    spirituous liquors will be inevitable, under any penalty the law may
    require; and until its prohibition is certain and effectual, every
    effort of Government, through the most faithful and indefatigable
    agents, will be useless. It would be, in my humble opinion, better to
    give up every thing to the Traders, and let them have the sole and
    entire control of the Indians, than permit them to contend at every
    point, with the views of the Government; and that contention made
    manifest, even to the most ignorant Indian.</p>

  <p>“While the agent is advising the Indians to give up the chase and
    settle themselves, with a view to agricultural pursuits, the Traders
    are urging them on in search of skins.</p>

  <p>“Far be it from me to be influenced or guided by improper or personal
    feeling, in the execution of my duty; but, Sir, I submit my opinion to
    a candid world, in relation to the subject, and feel fully convinced
    you will be able to see at once the course which will ever place the
    Indian Trader, and the present policy of Government, in relation to the
    Indians, at eternal war.</p>

  <p>“The missionaries sent amongst the several tribes are, no doubt,
    sincere in their intentions. I believe them to be so, from what I
    have seen; but, unfortunately, they commence their labours where they
    should end them. They should teach the Indians to work, by establishing
    schools of that description among them; induce them to live at home,
    abandon their restless and unsettled life, and live independent of the
    chase. After they are taught this, their intellectual faculties would
    be more susceptible of improvement of a moral and religious nature; and
    their steps towards civilization would become less difficult.”</p>

  <p>The Pawnees are divided into four bands, or families—designated by the
    names of Grand Pawnees—Tappage Pawnees—Republican Pawnees, and Wolf
    Pawnees.</p>

  <p>Each of these bands has a chief at its head; which chiefs, with all the
    nation, acknowledge a superior chief at whose voice they all move.</p>

  <p>At the head of the Grand Pawnees, is <em>Shon-ka-ki-he-ga</em>
    (the horse chief, <a href="#i_138"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 138</a>); and by the side of him,
    <em>Haw-che-ke-sug-ga</em> (he who kills the Osages, <a href="#i_139"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 139</a>),
    the aged chief of the Missouries, of whom I have spoken, and shall yet
    say more.</p>

  <p><em>La-doo-ke-a</em> (the buffalo bull, <a href="#i_140"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 140</a>), with his
    <em>medicine</em> or <em>totem</em> (the head of a buffalo) painted on his
    breast and his face, with bow and arrows in his hands, is a warrior of
    great distinction in the same band.</p>

  <p><em>Le-shaw-loo-lah-le-hoo</em> (the big elk, <a href="#i_141"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 141</a>), chief
    of the Wolf Pawnees, is another of the most distinguished of this tribe.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, I have also painted of this tribe, for
    my Museum, <em>Ah-shaw-wah-rooks-te</em> (the medicine horse);
    <em>La-kee-too-wi-ra-sha</em> (the little chief); <em>Loo-ra-we-re-coo</em>
    (the bird that goes to war); <em>Ah-sha-la-couts-a</em> (mole
    in the forehead); <em>La-shaw-le-staw-hix</em> (the man chief);
    <em>Te-ah-ke-ra-le-re-coo</em> (the Chayenne); <em>Lo-loch-to-hoo-la</em>
    (the big chief); <em>La-wah-ee-coots-la-shaw-no</em> (the brave chief);
    and <em>L’har-e-tar-rushe</em> (the ill-natured man).</p>

  <p>The Pawnees live in four villages, some few miles apart, on the banks
    of the Platte river, having their allies the Omahas and Ottoes so near
    to them as easily to act in concert, in case of invasion from any other
    tribe; and from the fact that half or more of them are supplied with
    guns and ammunition, they are able to withstand the assaults of any
    tribe that may come upon them.</p>

  <p>Of the Ottoes, <em>No-way-ke-sug-ga</em> (he who strikes two at once,
    <a href="#i_143"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 143</a>); and <em>Raw-no-way-woh-krah</em> (the loose
    pipe-stem, <a href="#i_144"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 144</a>), I have painted at full length, in
    beautiful costumes—the first with a necklace of grizzly bear’s claws,
    and his dress profusely fringed with scalp-locks; the second, in a
    tunic made of the entire skin of a grizzly bear, with a head-dress of
    the war-eagle’s quills.</p>

  <p>Besides these, I painted, also, <em>Wah-ro-nee-sah</em> (the surrounder);
    <em>Non-je-ning-a</em> (no heart); and <em>We-ke-ru-law</em> (he who
    exchanges).</p>

  <p>Of the Omahas, <em>Ki-ho-ga-waw-shu-shee</em> (the brave chief,
    <a href="#i_145"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 145</a>), is the head chief; and next to him in standing and
    reputation, is <em>Om-pa-ton-ga</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> (the big elk, <a href="#i_146"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 146</a>),
    with his tomahawk in his hand, and his face painted black, for war.</p>

  <p>Besides these, I painted <em>Man-ska-qui-ta</em> (the little
    soldier), a brave; <em>Shaw-da-mon-nee</em> (there he goes); and
    <em>Nom-ba-mon-nee</em> (the double walker).</p>

  <p>Of these wild tribes I have much more in store to say in future, and
    shall certainly make another budget of Letters from this place, or
    from other regions from whence I may wish to write, and <em>possibly,
    lack material</em>! All of these tribes, as well as the numerous
    semi-civilized remnants of tribes, that have been thrown out from the
    borders of our settlements, have missionary establishments and schools,
    as well as agricultural efforts amongst them; and will furnish valuable
    evidence as to the success that those philanthropic and benevolent
    exertions have met with, contending (as they have had to do) with the
    contaminating influences of whiskey-sellers, and other mercenary men,
    catering for their purses and their unholy appetites.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Since the above was written, I have had the very great
      pleasure of reading the notes of the Honourable Charles A. Murray,
      (who was for several months a guest amongst the Pawnees), and also of
      being several times a fellow-traveller with him in America; and at
      last a debtor to him for his signal kindness and friendship in London.
      Mr. Murray’s account of the Pawnees, as far as he saw them, is without
      doubt drawn with great fidelity, and he makes them out a pretty bad set
      of fellows. As I have before mentioned, there is probably not another
      tribe on the Continent, that has been more abused and incensed by the
      system of trade, and money-making, than the Pawnees; and the Honourable
      Mr. Murray, with his companion, made his way boldly into the heart of
      their country, without guide or interpreter, and I consider at great
      hazard to his life: and, from all the circumstances, I have been ready
      to congratulate him on getting out of their country as well as he did.

      <p>I mentioned in a former page, the awful destruction of this tribe by
        the small-pox; a few years previous to which, some one of the Fur
        Traders visited a threat upon these people, that if they did not comply
        with some condition, “he would let the small-pox out of a bottle and
        destroy the whole of them.” The pestilence has since been introduced
        accidentally amongst them by the Traders; and the standing tradition of
        the tribe now is, that “the Traders opened a bottle and let it out to
        destroy them.” Under such circumstances, from amongst a people who have
        been impoverished by the system of trade, without any body to protect
        him, I cannot but congratulate my Honourable friend for his peaceable
        retreat, where others before him have been less fortunate; and regret
        at the same time, that he could not have been my companion to some
        others of the remote tribes.</p>

  <div class="subheadc"><abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> LOUIS, <i>MISSOURI</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">My</span> little bark has been soaked in the water again, and Ba’tiste and
    Bogard have paddled, and I have steered and dodged our little craft
    amongst the snags and sawyers, until at last we landed the humble
    little thing amongst the huge steamers and floating palaces at the
    wharf of this bustling and growing city.</p>

  <p>And first of all, I must relate the fate of my little boat, which had
    borne us safe over two thousand miles of the Missouri’s turbid and
    boiling current, with no fault, excepting two or three instances, when
    the waves became too saucy, she, like the best of boats of her size,
    went to the bottom, and left us soused, to paddle our way to the shore,
    and drag out our things and dry them in the sun.</p>

  <p>When we landed at the wharf, my luggage was all taken out, and removed
    to my hotel; and when I returned a few hours afterwards, to look for my
    little boat, to which I had contracted a peculiar attachment (although
    I had left it in special charge of a person at work on the wharf); some
    <em>mystery</em> or <em>medicine</em> operation had relieved me from any
    further anxiety or trouble about it—it had gone and never returned,
    although it had safely passed the countries of mysteries, and had
    often laid weeks and months at the villages of red men, with no laws
    to guard it; and where it had also often been taken out of the water
    by <em>mystery-men</em>, and carried up the bank, and turned against my
    wigwam; and by them again safely carried to the river’s edge, and put
    afloat upon the water, when I was ready to take a seat in it.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, which is 1400 miles west of New York, is a flourishing
    town, of 15,000 inhabitants, and destined to be the great emporium of
    the West—the greatest inland town in America. Its location is on the
    Western bank of the Mississippi river, twenty miles below the mouth of
    the Missouri, and 1400 above the entrance of the Mississippi into the
    Gulf of Mexico.</p>

  <p>This is the great depôt of all the Fur Trading Companies to the Upper
    Missouri and Rocky Mountains, and their starting-place; and also for
    the Santa Fe, and other Trading Companies, who reach the Mexican
    borders overland, to trade for silver bullion, from the extensive mines
    of that rich country.</p>

  <p>I have also made it <em>my</em> starting-point, and place of deposit, to
    which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> send from different quarters, my packages of paintings and
    Indian articles, minerals, fossils, &amp;c., as I collect them in various
    regions, here to be stored till my return; and where on my <em>last
    return</em>, if I ever make it, I shall hustle them altogether, and
    remove them to the East.</p>

  <p>To this place I had transmitted by steamer and other conveyance, about
    twenty boxes and packages at different times, as my note-book shewed;
    and I have, on looking them up and enumerating them, been lucky enough
    to recover and recognize about fifteen of the twenty, which is a pretty
    fair proportion for this wild and desperate country, and the very
    <em>conscientious hands</em> they often are doomed to pass through.</p>

  <p>Ba’tiste and Bogard (poor fellows) I found, after remaining here a few
    days, had been about as unceremoniously snatched off, as my little
    canoe; and Bogard, in particular, as he had made show of a few hundred
    dollars, which he had saved of his hard earnings in the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>He came down with a liberal heart, which he had learned in an Indian
    life of ten years, with a strong taste, which he had acquired, for
    whiskey, in a country where it was sold for twenty dollars per gallon;
    and with an independent feeling, which illy harmonized with rules and
    regulations of a country of laws; and the consequence soon was, that by
    the “Hawk and Buzzard” system, and Rocky Mountain liberality, and Rocky
    Mountain prodigality, the poor fellow was soon “jugged up;” where he
    could deliberately dream of beavers, and the free and cooling breezes
    of the mountain air, without the pleasure of setting his trap for the
    one, or even indulging the hope of ever again having the pleasure of
    breathing the other.</p>

  <p>I had imbibed rather less of these delightful passions in the Indian
    country, and consequently indulged less in them when I came back; and
    of course, was rather more fortunate than poor Bogard, whose feelings
    I soothed as far as it laid in my power, and prepared to “lay my
    course” to the South, with colours and canvass in readiness for another
    campaign.</p>

  <p>In my sojourn in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, amongst many other kind and congenial
    friends whom I met, I have had daily interviews with the venerable
    Governor Clark, whose whitened locks are still shaken in roars of
    laughter, and good jests among the numerous citizens, who all love him,
    and continually rally around him in his hospitable mansion.</p>

  <p>Governor Clark, with Captain Lewis, were the first explorers across the
    Rocky Mountains, and down the Colombia to the Pacific Ocean thirty-two
    years ago; whose tour has been published in a very interesting work,
    which has long been before the world. My works and my design have
    been warmly approved and applauded by this excellent patriarch of the
    Western World; and kindly recommended by him in such ways as have been
    of great service to me. Governor Clark is now Superintendent of Indian
    Affairs for all the Western and North Western regions; and surely,
    their interests could never have been intrusted to better or abler
    hands.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>So long have I been recruiting, and enjoying the society of friends in
    this town, that the navigation of the river has suddenly closed, being
    entirely frozen over; and the earth’s surface covered with eighteen
    inches of drifting snow, which has driven me to the only means, and I
    start in a day or two, with a tough little pony and a packhorse, to
    trudge through the snow drifts from this to New Madrid, and perhaps
    further; a distance of three or four hundred miles to the South—where
    I must venture to meet a warmer climate—the river open, and steamers
    running, to waft me to the Gulf of Mexico. Of the fate or success
    that waits me, or of the incidents of that travel, as they have not
    transpired, I can as yet say nothing; and I close my book for further
    time and future entries.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">PENSACOLA, <i>WEST FLORIDA</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">From</span> my long silence of late, you will no doubt have deemed me out of
    the <em>civil</em> and perhaps out of the <em>whole world</em>.</p>

  <p>I have, to be sure, been a great deal of the time <em>out of the
    limits</em> of one and, at times, nearly <em>out of</em> the other. Yet I
    am <em>living</em>, and hold in my possession a number of epistles which
    passing events had dictated, but which I neglected to transmit at the
    proper season. In my headlong transit through the Southern tribes of
    Indians, I have “<em>popped out</em>” of the woods upon this glowing
    land, and I cannot forego the pleasure of letting you into a few of the
    secrets of this delightful place.</p>

  <p>“<em>Flos—floris</em>,” &amp;c. every body knows the meaning of; and
    <em>Florida</em>, in Spanish, is a country of flowers.—<em>Perdido</em> is
    <em>perdition</em>, and Rio Perdido, <em>River</em> of <em>Perdition</em>.
    Looking down its perpendicular banks into its black water, its depth
    would seem to be <em>endless</em>, and the doom of the unwary to be
    gloomy in the extreme. Step not accidentally or wilfully over its
    fatal brink, and Nature’s opposite extreme is spread about you. You
    are <em>literally</em> in the land of the “cypress and myrtle”—where the
    ever-green live oak and lofty magnolia dress the forest in a perpetual
    mantle of green.</p>

  <p>The sudden transition from the ice-bound regions of the North to this
    mild climate, in the midst of winter, is one of peculiar pleasure. At a
    half-way of the distance, one’s cloak is thrown aside; and arrived on
    the ever-verdant borders of Florida, the bosom is opened and bared to
    the soft breeze from the ocean’s wave, and the congenial warmth of a
    summer’s sun.</p>

  <p>Such is the face of Nature here in the rude month of February;
    green peas are served on the table—other garden vegetables in great
    perfection, and garden flowers, as well as wild, giving their full and
    sweetest perfume to the winds.</p>

  <p>I looked into the deep and bottomless <em>Perdido</em>, and beheld about
    it the thousand charms which Nature has spread to allure the unwary
    traveller to its brink. ’Twas not enough to entangle him in a web
    of sweets upon its borders, but <em>Nature</em> seems to have used an
    <em>art</em> to draw him to its <em>bottom</em>, by the voluptuous buds
    which blossom under its black waters, and whose vivid colours are
    softened and enriched the deeper they are seen below its surface.
    The sweetest of wild flowers enamel the shores and spangle the dark
    green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> tapestry which hangs over its bosom—the stately <em>magnolia</em>
    towers fearlessly over its black waters, and sheds (with the myrtle and
    jessamine) the richest perfume over this chilling pool of death.</p>

  <p>How exquisitely pure and sweet are the delicate tendrils which Nature
    has hung over these scenes of melancholy and gloom! and how strong,
    also, has she fixed in man’s breast the passion to possess and enjoy
    them! I could have hung by the tree tops over that fatal stream, or
    blindly staggered over its thorny brink to have culled the sweets which
    are found only in its bosom; but the <em>poisonous fang</em>, I was told,
    was continually aimed at my heel, and I left the sweetened atmosphere
    of its dark and gloomy, yet enamelled shores.</p>

  <p>Florida is, in a great degree, a dark and sterile wilderness, yet
    with spots of beauty and of loveliness, with charms that cannot be
    forgotten. Her swamps and everglades, the dens of alligators, and
    lurking places of the desperate savage, gloom the thoughts of the wary
    traveller, whose mind is cheered and lit to admiration, when in the
    solitary pine woods, where he hears nought but the echoing notes of the
    <em>sand-hill cranes</em>, or the howling wolf, he suddenly breaks out
    into the open savannahs, teeming with their myriads of wild flowers,
    and palmettos (<a href="#i_147"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 147</a>); or where the winding path through
    which he is wending his lonely way, suddenly brings him out upon the
    beach, where the rolling sea has thrown up her thousands of hills and
    mounds of sand as white as the drifted snow, over which her green waves
    are lashing, and sliding back again to her deep green and agitated
    bosom (<a href="#i_148"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 148</a>). This sketch was made on <em>Santa Rosa
    Island</em>, within a few miles of Pensacola, of a favourite spot for
    <em>tea</em> (and other convivial) <em>parties</em>, which are often held
    there. The hills of sand are as <em>purely white as snow</em>, and fifty
    or sixty feet in height, and supporting on their tops, and in their
    sides, clusters of magnolia bushes—of myrtle—of palmetto and heather,
    all of which are evergreens, forming the most vivid contrast with the
    snow-white sand in which they are growing. On the beach a family of
    Seminole Indians are encamped, catching and drying red fish, their
    chief article of food.</p>

  <p>I have traversed the snow-white shores of Pensacola’s beautiful bay,
    and I said to myself, “Is it possible that Nature has done so much
    in vain—or will the wisdom of man lead him to add to such works the
    embellishments of art, and thus convert to his own use and enjoyment
    the greatest luxuries of life?” As a travelling stranger through the
    place, I said “yes: it must be so.” Nature has here formed the finest
    harbour in the world; and the dashing waves of the ocean have thrown
    around its shores the purest barriers of sand, as white as the drifted
    snow. Unlike all other Southern ports, it is surrounded by living
    fountains of the purest water, and its shores continually fanned by the
    refreshing breathings of the sea. To a Northern man, the winters in
    this place appear like a continual spring time; and the intensity of a
    summer’s sun is cooled into comfort and luxury by the ever-cheering sea
    breeze.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

  <p>This is the only place I have found in the Southern country to which
    Northern people can repair with safety in the summer season; and I know
    not of a place in the world where they can go with better guarantees
    of good health, and a reasonable share of the luxuries of life. The
    town of Pensacola is beautifully situated on the shore of the bay,
    and contains at present about fifteen hundred inhabitants, most of
    them Spanish Creoles. They live an easy and idle life, without any
    energy further than for the mere means of living. The bay abounds in
    the greatest variety of fish, which are easily taken, and the finest
    quality of oysters are found in profusion, even alongside of the
    wharves.</p>

  <p>Government having fixed upon this harbour as the great naval depôt
    for all the Southern coast, the consequence will be, that a vast sum
    of public money will always be put into circulation in this place;
    and the officers of the navy, together with the officers of the army,
    stationed in the three forts built and now building at this place, will
    constitute the most polished and desirable society in our country.</p>

  <p>What Pensacola <em>has been</em> or <em>is</em>, in a commercial point of
    view, little can be said; but what it <em>can be</em>, and most certainly
    <em>will be</em>, in a few years, the most sanguine can hardly predict.
    I would unhesitatingly recommend this to the enterprising capitalists
    of the North, as a place where they can <em>live</em>, and where (if
    nature has been kind, as experience has taught us) they <em>will</em>
    flourish. A few such men have taken their stand here within a few
    months past; and, as a first step towards their aggrandizement, a plan
    of a rail-road has been projected, from Pensacola to Columbus, in
    Georgia; which needs only to be completed, to place Pensacola at once
    before any other town on the Southern coast, excepting New Orleans.
    Of the feasibility of such a work, there is not the slightest doubt;
    and, from the opinions advanced by Captain Chase and Lieutenant Bowman,
    two of the most distinguished engineers of the army, it would seem as
    if Nature had formed a level nearly the whole way, and supplied the
    best kind of timber on the spot for its erection. The route of this
    rail-road would be through or near the principal cotton-growing part of
    Alabama, and the quantity of produce from that state, as well as from
    a great part of the state of Georgia, which would seek this market,
    would be almost incalculable. Had this road been in operation during
    the past winter, it has been ascertained by a simple calculation, that
    the cotton-growers of Alabama, might have saved 2,000,000 of dollars
    on their crop; by being enabled to have got it early into market, and
    received the first price of 18¾ cents, instead of waiting six weeks or
    two months for a rise of water, enabling them to get it to Mobile—at
    which time it had fallen to nine cents per pound.</p>

  <p>As a work also of <em>national utility</em>, it would rank amongst the
    most important in our country, and the Government might afford to
    appropriate the whole sum necessary for its construction. In a period
    of war, when in all probability, for a great part of the time, this
    port may be in a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>state of blockade, such a communication with the
    interior of the country, would be of incalculable benefit for the
    transportation of men—of produce and munitions of war.</p>

  <p>Of the few remnants of Indians remaining in this part of the country, I
    have little to say, at present, that could interest you. The sum total
    that can be learned or seen of them (like all others that are half
    civilized) is, that they are to be pitied.</p>

  <p>The direful “<em>trump of war</em>” is blowing in East Florida, where I
    was “steering my course;” and I shall in a few days turn my steps in a
    different direction.</p>

  <p>Since you last heard from me, I have added on to my former Tour “down
    the river,” the remainder of the Mississippi (or rather Missouri),
    from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to New Orleans; and I find that, from its source to
    the Balize, the distance is 4500 <em>miles only</em>! I shall be on the
    wing again in a few days, for a shake of the hand with the Camanchees,
    Osages, Pawnees, Kioways, Arapahoes, &amp;c.—some hints of whom I shall
    certainly give you from their different localities, provided I can keep
    the hair on my head.</p>

  <p>This Tour will lead me up the Arkansas to its source, and into the
    Rocky Mountains, under the protection of the United States dragoons.
    You will begin to think ere long, that I shall acquaint myself pretty
    well with the manners and customs of our country—at least with the
    <em>out-land-ish</em> part of it.</p>

  <p>I shall hail the day with pleasure, when I can again reach the free
    land of the lawless savage; for far more agreeable to my ear is the
    Indian yell and war-whoop, than the civilized groans and murmurs about
    “<em>pressure</em>,” “<em>deposites</em>,” “<em>banks</em>,” “<em>boundary
    questions</em>,” &amp;c.; and I vanish from the country with the sincere
    hope that these tedious words may become <em>obsolete</em> before I
    return. Adieu.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT GIBSON, <i>ARKANSAS TERRITORY</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the date of my last Letter at Pensacola, in Florida, I travelled
    to New Orleans, and from thence up the Mississippi several hundred
    miles, to the mouth of the Arkansas; and up the Arkansas, 700 miles to
    this place. We wended our way up, between the pictured shores of this
    beautiful river, on the steamer “Arkansas,” until within 200 miles
    of this post; when we got aground, and the water falling fast, left
    the steamer nearly on dry ground. Hunting and fishing, and whist, and
    sleeping, and eating, were our principal amusements to deceive away
    the time, whilst we were waiting for the water to rise. Lieutenant
    Seaton, of the army, was one of my companions in misery, whilst we
    lay two weeks or more without prospect of further progress—the poor
    fellow on his way to his post to join his regiment, had left his trunk,
    unfortunately, with all his clothes in it; and by hunting and fishing
    in shirts that I loaned him, or from other causes, we became yoked in
    amusements, in catering for our table—in getting fish and wild fowl;
    and, after that, as the “last kick” for amusement and pastime, with
    another good companion by the name of Chadwick, we clambered up and
    over the rugged mountains’ sides, from day to day, turning stones to
    catch <em>centipedes</em> and <em>tarantulas</em>, of which poisonous
    reptiles we caged a number; and on the boat amused ourselves by betting
    on their battles, which were immediately fought, and life almost
    instantly taken, when they came together.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>In this, and fifty other ways, we whiled away the heavy time: but yet,
    at last we reached our destined goal, and here we are at present fixed.
    Fort Gibson is the extreme south-western outpost on the United States
    frontier; beautifully situated on the banks of the river, in the midst
    of an extensive and lovely prairie; and is at present occupied by the
    7th regiment of United States infantry, heretofore under the command of
    General Arbuckle, one of the oldest officers on the frontier, and the
    original builder of the post.</p>

  <p>Being soon to leave this little civilized world for a campaign in the
    Indian country, I take this opportunity to bequeath a few words before
    the moment of departure. Having sometime since obtained permission
    from the Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> of War to accompany the regiment of the United
    States dragoons in their summer campaign, I <em>reported</em> myself
    at this place two months ago, where I have been waiting ever since
    for their organization.—After the many difficulties which they have
    had to encounter, they have at length all assembled—the grassy plains
    are resounding with the trampling hoofs of the prancing war-horse—and
    already the hills are echoing back the notes of the spirit-stirring
    trumpets, which are sounding for the onset. The <em>natives</em> are
    again “to be astonished,” and I shall probably again be a witness to
    the scene. But whether the approach of eight hundred mounted dragoons
    amongst the Camanchees and Pawnees, will afford me a better subject
    for a picture of a <em>gaping</em> and <em>astounded multitude</em>, than
    did the first approach of our steam-boat amongst the Mandans, &amp;c.,
    is a question yet to be solved. I am strongly inclined to think that
    the scene will not be less wild and spirited, and I ardently wish it;
    for I have become so much Indian of late, that my pencil has lost all
    appetite for subjects that savour of tameness. I should delight in
    seeing these red knights of the lance astonished, for it is then that
    they shew their brightest hues—and I care not how badly we frighten
    them, provided we hurt them not, nor frighten them out of <em>sketching
    distance</em>. You will agree with me, that I am going farther to
    get <em>sitters</em>, than any of my fellow-artists ever did; but I
    take an indescribable pleasure in roaming through Nature’s trackless
    wilds, and selecting my models, where I am free and unshackled by the
    killing restraints of society; where a painter must modestly sit and
    breathe away in agony the edge and soul of his inspiration, waiting
    for the sluggish <em>calls</em> of the civil. Though the toil, the
    privations, and expense of travelling to these remote parts of the
    world to get subjects for my pencil, place almost insurmountable, and
    sometimes <em>painful</em> obstacles before me, yet I am encouraged by
    the continual conviction that I am practising in the <em>true School
    of the Arts</em>; and that, though I should get as poor as Lazarus, I
    should deem myself rich in models and studies for the future occupation
    of my life. Of this much I am certain—that amongst these sons of the
    forest, where are continually repeated the feats and gambols equal to
    the Grecian Games, I have learned more of the essential parts of my art
    in the three last years, than I could have learned in New York in a
    life-time.</p>

  <p>The landscape scenes of these wild and beautiful regions, are, of
    themselves, a rich reward for the traveller who can place them in his
    portfolio: and being myself the only one accompanying the dragoons for
    scientific purposes, there will be an additional pleasure to be derived
    from those pursuits. The regiment of eight hundred men, with whom I
    am to travel, will be an effective force, and a perfect protection
    against any attacks that will ever be made by Indians. It is composed
    principally of young men of respectable families, who would act, on all
    occasions, from feelings of pride and honour, in addition to those of
    the common soldier.</p>

  <p>The day before yesterday the regiment of dragoons and the 7th regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
    of infantry, stationed here, were reviewed by General Leavenworth, who
    has lately arrived at this post, superseding Colonel Arbuckle in the
    command.</p>

  <p>Both regiments were drawn up in battle array, in <em>fatigue dress</em>,
    and passing through a number of the manœuvres of battle, of charge and
    repulse, &amp;c., presenting a novel and thrilling scene in the prairie, to
    the thousands of Indians and others who had assembled to witness the
    display. The proud and manly deportment of these young men remind one
    forcibly of a regiment of Independent Volunteers, and the horses have a
    most beautiful appearance from the arrangement of colours. Each company
    of horses has been selected of one colour entire. There is a company of
    <em>bays</em>, a company of <em>blacks</em>, one of <em>whites</em>, one of
    <em>sorrels</em>, one of <em>greys</em>, one of <em>cream</em> colour, &amp;c.
    &amp;c., which render the companies distinct, and the effect exceedingly
    pleasing. This regiment goes out under the command of Colonel Dodge,
    and from his well tested qualifications, and from the beautiful
    equipment of the command, there can be little doubt but that they
    will do credit to themselves and an honour to their country; so far
    as honours can be gained and laurels can be plucked from their wild
    stems in a savage country. The object of this summer’s campaign seems
    to be to cultivate an acquaintance with the Pawnees and Camanchees.
    These are two extensive tribes of roaming Indians, who, from their
    extreme ignorance of us, have not yet recognized the United States in
    treaty, and have struck frequent blows on our frontiers and plundered
    our traders who are traversing their country. For this I cannot so much
    blame them, for the Spaniards are gradually advancing upon them on one
    side, and the Americans on the other, and fast destroying the furs
    and game of their country, which God gave them as their only wealth
    and means of subsistence. This movement of the dragoons <em>seems</em>
    to be one of the most humane in its views, and I heartily hope that
    it may prove so in the event, as well for our own sakes as for that
    of the Indian. I can see no reason why we should march upon them with
    an invading army carrying with it the spirit of chastisement. The
    object of Government undoubtedly is to effect a friendly meeting with
    them, that they may see and respect us, and to establish something
    like a system of mutual rights with them. To penetrate their country
    with the other view, that of chastising them, even with five times
    the number that are now going, would be entirely futile, and perhaps
    <em>disastrous</em> in the extreme. It is a pretty thing (and perhaps
    an easy one, in the estimation of the world) for an army of mounted
    men to be gaily prancing over the boundless green fields of the West,
    and it <em>is</em> so for a little distance—but it would be well that
    the world should be apprised of some of the actual difficulties that
    oppose themselves to the success of such a campaign, that they may not
    censure too severely, in case this command should fail to accomplish
    the objects for which they were organized.</p>

  <p>In the first place, from the great difficulty of organizing and
    equipping, these troops are starting too late in the season for their
    summer’s campaign, by two months. The journey which they have to
    perform is a very long one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> and although the first part of it will be
    picturesque and pleasing, the after part of it will be tiresome and
    fatiguing in the extreme. As they advance to the West, the grass (and
    consequently the game) will be gradually diminishing, and water in many
    parts of the county not to be found.</p>

  <p>As the troops will be obliged to subsist themselves a great part of the
    way, it will be extremely difficult to do it under such circumstances,
    and at the same time hold themselves in readiness, with half-famished
    horses and men nearly exhausted, to contend with a numerous enemy who
    are at home, on the ground on which they were born, with horses fresh
    and ready for action. It is not probable, however, that the Indians
    will venture to take advantage of such circumstances; but I am inclined
    to think, that the expedition will be more likely to fail from another
    source: it is my opinion that the appearance of so large a military
    force in their country, will alarm the Indians to that degree, that
    they will fly with their families to their hiding-places amongst those
    barren deserts, which they themselves can reach only by great fatigue
    and extreme privation, and to which our half-exhausted troops cannot
    possibly follow them. From these haunts their warriors would advance
    and annoy the regiment as much as they could, by striking at their
    hunting parties and cutting off their supplies. To attempt to pursue
    them, if they cannot be called to a council, would be as useless as
    to follow the wind; for our troops in such a case, are in a country
    where they are obliged to subsist themselves, and the Indians being on
    fresh horses, with a supply of provisions, would easily drive all the
    buffaloes ahead of them; and endeavour, as far as possible, to decoy
    our troops into the barren parts of the country, where they could not
    find the means of subsistence.</p>

  <p>The plan designed to be pursued, and the only one that can succeed,
    is to send runners to the different bands, explaining the friendly
    intentions of our Government, and to invite them to a meeting. For this
    purpose several Camanchee and Pawnee prisoners have been purchased from
    the Osages, who may be of great service in bringing about a friendly
    interview.</p>

  <p>I ardently hope that this plan may succeed, for I am anticipating
    great fatigue and privation in the endeavour to see these wild tribes
    together; that I may be enabled to lay before the world a just estimate
    of their manners and customs.</p>

  <p>I hope that my suggestions may not be truly prophetic; but I am
    constrained to say, that I doubt very much whether we shall see
    anything more of them than their trails, and the sites of their
    deserted villages.</p>

  <p>Several companies have already started from this place; and the
    remaining ones will be on their march in a day or two. General
    Leavenworth will accompany them 200 miles, to the mouth of False
    Washita, and I shall be attached to his staff. Incidents which may
    occur, I shall record. Adieu.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the mean time, as it may be long before I can

  <div class="subheadc">FORT GIBSON, <i>ARKANSAS</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> two months have elapsed since I arrived at this post, on my way
    up the river from the Mississippi, to join the regiment of dragoons on
    their campaign into the country of the Camanchees and Pawnee Picts;
    during which time, I have been industriously at work with my brush and
    my pen, recording the looks and the deeds of the Osages, who inhabit
    the country on the North and the West of this.</p>

  <p>The Osage, or (as they call themselves) <em>Wa-saw-see</em>, are a tribe
    of about 5200 in numbers, inhabiting and hunting over the head-waters
    of the Arkansas, and Neosho or Grand Rivers. Their present residence
    is about 700 miles West of the Mississippi river: in three villages,
    constituted of wigwams, built of barks and flags or reeds. One of these
    villages is within forty miles of this Fort; another within sixty, and
    the third about eighty miles. Their chief place of trade is with the
    sutlers at this post; and there are constantly more or less of them
    encamped about the garrison.</p>

  <p>The Osages may justly be said to be the tallest race of men in North
    America, either of red or white skins; there being very few indeed of
    the men, at their full growth, who are less than six feet in stature,
    and very many of them six and a half, and others seven feet. They are
    at the same time well-proportioned in their limbs, and good looking;
    being rather narrow in the shoulders, and, like most all very tall
    people, a little inclined to stoop; not throwing the chest out, and
    the head and shoulders back, quite as much as the Crows and Mandans,
    and other tribes amongst which I have been familiar. Their movement is
    graceful and quick; and in war and the chase, I think they are equal to
    any of the tribes about them.</p>

  <p>This tribe, though living, as they long have, near the borders of
    the civilized community, have studiously rejected everything of
    civilized customs; and are uniformly dressed in skins of their own
    dressing—strictly maintaining their primitive looks and manners,
    without the slightest appearance of innovations, excepting in the
    blankets, which have been recently admitted to their use instead of the
    buffalo robes, which are now getting scarce amongst them.</p>

  <p>The Osages are one of the tribes who shave the head, as I have before
    described when speaking of the Pawnees and Konzas, and they decorate
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>and paint it with great care, and some considerable taste. There is
    a peculiarity in the heads of these people which is very striking to
    the eye of a traveller; and which I find is produced by artificial
    means in infancy. Their children, like those of all the other tribes,
    are carried on a board, and slung upon the mother’s back. The infants
    are lashed to the boards, with their backs upon them, apparently in
    a very uncomfortable condition; and with the Osages, the head of the
    child bound down so tight to the board, as to force in the occipital
    bone, and create an unnatural deficiency on the back part, and
    consequently more than a natural elevation of the top of the head.
    This custom, they told me they practiced, because “it pressed out a
    bold and manly appearance in front.” This I think, from observation,
    to be rather imaginary than real; as I cannot see that they exhibit
    any extraordinary development in the front; though they evidently
    shew a striking deficiency on the back part, and also an unnatural
    elevation on the top of the head, which is, no doubt, produced by this
    custom. The difference between this mode and the one practiced by the
    Flathead Indians beyond the Rocky Mountains, consists in this, that the
    Flatheads press the head <em>between</em> two boards; the one pressing
    the frontal bone down, whilst the other is pressing the occipital up,
    producing the most frightful deformity; whilst the Osages merely press
    the occipital in, and that, but to a moderate degree, occasioning but
    a slight, and in many cases, almost immaterial, departure from the
    symmetry of nature.</p>

  <p>These people, like all those tribes who shave the head, cut and slit
    their ears very much, and suspend from them great quantities of wampum
    and tinsel ornaments. Their necks are generally ornamented also with
    a profusion of wampum and beads; and as they live in a warm climate
    where there is not so much necessity for warm clothing, as amongst the
    more Northern tribes, of whom I have been heretofore speaking; their
    shoulders, arms, and chests are generally naked, and painted in a great
    variety of picturesque ways, with silver bands on the wrists, and
    oftentimes a profusion of rings on the fingers.</p>

  <p>The head-chief of the Osages at this time, is a young man by the name
    of Clermont (<a href="#i_150"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 150</a>), the son of a very distinguished chief
    of that name, who recently died; leaving his son his successor, with
    the consent of the tribe. I painted the portrait of this chief at full
    length, in a beautiful dress, his leggings fringed with scalp-locks,
    and in his hand his favourite and valued war-club.</p>

  <p>By his side I have painted also at full length, his wife and child
    (<a href="#i_151"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 151</a>). She was richly dressed in costly cloths of
    civilized manufacture, which is almost a solitary instance amongst
    the Osages, who so studiously reject every luxury and every custom
    of civilized people; and amongst those, the use of whiskey, which is
    on all sides tendered to them—but almost uniformly rejected! This
    is an unusual and unaccountable thing, unless the influence which
    the missionaries and teachers have exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> over them, has induced
    them to abandon the pernicious and destructive habit of drinking to
    excess. From what I can learn, the Osages were once fond of whiskey;
    and, like all other tribes who have had the opportunity, were in the
    habit of using it to excess. Several very good and exemplary men have
    been for years past exerting their greatest efforts, with those of
    their families, amongst these people; having established schools and
    agricultural experiments amongst them. And I am fully of the opinion,
    that this decided anomaly in the Indian country, has resulted from the
    devoted exertions of these pious and good men.</p>

  <p>Amongst the chiefs of the Osages, and probably the next in authority
    and respect in the tribe, is Tchong-tas-sab-bee, the black dog
    (<a href="#i_152"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 152</a>), whom I painted also at full length, with his
    pipe in one hand, and his tomahawk in the other; his head shaved, and
    ornamented with a beautiful crest of deers’ hair, and his body wrapped
    in a huge mackinaw blanket.</p>

  <p>This dignitary, who is blind in the left eye, is one of the most
    conspicuous characters in all this country, rendered so by his huge
    size (standing in height and in girth, above all of his tribe), as
    well as by his extraordinary life. The Black Dog is familiarly known
    to all the officers of the army, as well as to Traders and all other
    white men, who have traversed these regions, and I believe, admired and
    respected by most of them.</p>

  <p>His height, I think, is seven feet; and his limbs full and rather
    fat, making his bulk formidable, and weighing, perhaps, some 250
    or 300 pounds. This man is chief of one of the three bands of the
    Osages, divided as they are into three families; occupying, as I
    before said, three villages, denominated, “Clermont’s Village,” “Black
    Dog’s Village,” and “White Hair’s Village.” The White Hair is another
    distinguished leader of the Osages; and some have awarded to him the
    title of <em>Head Chief</em>; but in the jealous feelings of rivalry
    which have long agitated this tribe, and some times, even endangered
    its peace, I believe it has been generally agreed that his claims are
    third in the tribe; though he justly claims the title of a chief, and a
    very gallant and excellent man. The portrait of this man, I regret to
    say, I did not get.</p>

  <p>Amongst the many brave and distinguished warriors of the tribe, one of
    the most noted and respected is Tal-lee (<a href="#i_153"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 153</a>), painted
    at full length, with his lance in his hand—his shield on his arm, and
    his bow and quiver slung upon his back.</p>

  <p>In this portrait, there is a fair specimen of the Osage figure and
    dress, as well as of the facial outline, and shape and character of the
    head, and mode of dressing and ornamenting it with the helmet-crest,
    and the eagle’s quill.</p>

  <p>If I had the time at present, I would unfold to the reader some of the
    pleasing and extraordinary incidents of this gallant fellow’s military
    life; and also the anecdotes that have grown out of the familiar
    life I have led with this handsome and high-minded <em>gentleman</em>
    of the wild woods and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>prairies. Of the Black Dog I should say
    more also; and most assuredly will not fail to do justice to these
    extraordinary men, when I have leisure to write off all my notes, and
    turn biographer. At present, I shake hands with these two noblemen, and
    bid them good-bye; promising them, that if I never get time to say more
    of their virtues—I shall say nothing against them.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">plates</span> <a href="#i_154">154</a>, <a href="#i_154">155</a>, <a href="#i_154">156</a>, I have represented three braves,
    Ko-ha-tunk-a (the big crow); Nah-com-e-shee (the man of the bed), and
    Mun-ne-pus-kee (he who is not afraid). These portraits set forth fairly
    the modes of dress and ornaments of the young men of the tribe, from
    the tops of their heads to the soles of their feet. The only dress they
    wear in warm weather is the breech-cloth, leggings, and moccasins of
    dressed skins, and garters worn immediately below the knee, ornamented
    profusely with beads and wampum.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>These three distinguished and ambitious young men, were of the best
    families in the Osage nation; and as they explained to me, having
    formed a peculiar attachment to each other—they desired me to paint
    them all on one canvass, in which wish I indulged them.</p>

  <p>Besides the above personages, I also painted the portraits of
    <em>Wa-ho-beck-ee</em> (————), a brave, and said to be the handsomest
    man in the Osage nation; <em>Moi-een-e-shee</em> (the constant walker);
    <em>Wa-mash-ee-sheek</em> (he who takes away); <em>Wa-chesh-uk</em> (war);
    <em>Mink-chesk</em> (————); <em>Wash-im-pe-shee</em> (the mad man), a
    distinguished warrior; <em>Shin-ga-wos-sa</em> (the handsome bird);
    <em>Cah-he-ga-shin-ga</em> (the little chief), and <em>Tcha-to-ga</em>
    (the mad buffalo); all of which will hang in my <span class="smcap">Indian Museum</span>
    for the inspection of the curious. The last mentioned of these was
    tried and convicted of the murder of two white men during Adams’s
    administration, and was afterwards pardoned, and still lives, though in
    disgrace in his tribe, as one whose life had been forfeited, “but (as
    they say) not worth taking.”</p>

  <p>The Osages have been formerly, and until quite recently, a powerful
    and warlike tribe; carrying their arms fearlessly through all of
    these realms; and ready to cope with foes of any kind that they were
    liable to meet. At present, the case is quite different; they have
    been repeatedly moved and jostled along, from the head waters of the
    White river, and even from the shores of the Mississippi, to where
    they now are; and reduced by every war and every move. The small-pox
    has taken its share of them at two or three different times; and the
    Konzas, as they are now called, having been a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>part of the Osages, and
    receded from them, impaired their strength; and have at last helped
    to lessen the number of their warriors; so that their decline has
    been very rapid, bringing them to the mere handful that now exists of
    them; though still preserving their valour as warriors, which they
    are continually shewing off as bravely and as professionally as they
    can, with the Pawnees and the Camanchees, with whom they are waging
    incessant war; although they are the principal sufferers in those
    scenes which they fearlessly persist in, as if they were actually bent
    on their self-destruction. Very great efforts have been, and are being
    made amongst these people to civilize and christianize them; and still
    I believe with but little success. Agriculture they have caught but
    little of; and of religion and civilization still less. One good result
    has, however, been produced by these faithful labourers, which is the
    conversion of these people to temperance; which I consider the first
    important step towards the other results, and which of itself is an
    achievement that redounds much to the credit and humanity of those,
    whose lives have been devoted to its accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Here I must leave the Osages for the present, but not the reader, whose
    company I still hope to have awhile longer, to hear how I get along
    amongst the wild and untried scenes, that I am to start upon in a few
    days, in company with the first regiment of dragoons, in the first
    grand <em>civilized foray</em>, into the country of the wild and warlike
    Camanchees.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF FALSE WASHITA, <i>RED RIVER</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the protection of the United States dragoons, I arrived at
    this place three days since, on my way again in search of the “Far
    West.” How far I may <em>this time</em> follow the flying phantom, is
    uncertain. I am already again in the land of the <em>buffaloes</em> and
    the <em>fleet-bounding antelopes</em>; and I anticipate, with many other
    beating hearts, rare sport and amusement amongst the wild herds ere long.</p>

  <p>We shall start from hence in a few days, and other epistles I may
    occasionally drop you from <em>terra incognita</em>, for such is the
    great expanse of country which we expect to range over; and names we
    are to give, and country to explore, as far as we proceed. We are, at
    this place, on the banks of the Red River, having Texas under our eye
    on the opposite bank. Our encampment is on the point of land between
    the Red and False Washita rivers, at their junction; and the country
    about us is a panorama too beautiful to be painted with a pen: it is,
    like most of the country in these regions, composed of prairie and
    timber, alternating in the most delightful shapes and proportions
    that the eye of a connoisseur could desire. The verdure is everywhere
    of the deepest green, and the plains about us are literally speckled
    with buffalo. We are distant from Fort Gibson about 200 miles, which
    distance we accomplished in ten days.</p>

  <p>A great part of the way, the country is prairie, gracefully
    undulating—well watered, and continually beautified by copses and
    patches of timber. On our way my attention was rivetted to the tops
    of some of the prairie bluffs, whose summits I approached with
    inexpressible delight. I rode to the top of one of these noble mounds,
    in company with my friends Lieut. Wheelock and Joseph Chadwick, where
    we agreed that our <em>horses</em> instinctively <em>looked</em> and
    <em>admired</em>. They thought not of the rich herbage that was under
    their feet, but, with deep-drawn sighs, their necks were loftily
    curved, and their eyes widely stretched over the landscape that was
    beneath us. From this elevated spot, the horizon was bounded all
    around us by mountain streaks of blue, softening into azure as they
    vanished, and the pictured vales that intermediate lay, were deepening
    into green as the eye was returning from its roamings. Beneath us, and
    winding through the waving landscape was seen with peculiar effect,
    the “bold dragoons,” marching in beautiful order forming a train of a
    mile in length. Baggage waggons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> Indians (<i lang="fr">engagés</i>) helped to
    lengthen the procession. From the point where we stood, the line was
    seen in miniature; and the undulating hills over which it was bending
    its way, gave it the appearance of a huge black snake gracefully
    gliding over a rich carpet of green.</p>

  <p>This picturesque country of 200 miles, over which we have passed,
    belongs to the Creeks and Choctaws, and affords one of the richest and
    most desirable countries in the world for agricultural pursuits.</p>

  <p>Scarcely a day has passed, in which we have not crossed oak ridges,
    of several miles in breadth, with a sandy soil and scattering timber;
    where the ground was almost literally covered with vines, producing the
    greatest profusion of delicious grapes, of five-eighths of an inch in
    diameter, and hanging in such endless clusters, as justly to entitle
    this singular and solitary wilderness to the style of a vineyard (and
    ready for the vintage), for many miles together.</p>

  <p>The next hour we would be trailing through broad and verdant valleys of
    green prairies, into which we had descended; and oftentimes find our
    progress completely arrested by hundreds of acres of small plum-trees,
    of four or six feet in height; so closely woven and interlocked
    together, as entirely to dispute our progress, and sending us several
    miles around; when every bush that was in sight was so loaded with the
    weight of its delicious wild fruit, that they were in many instances
    literally without leaves on their branches, and bent quite to the
    ground. Amongst these, and in patches, were intervening beds of wild
    roses, wild currants, and gooseberries. And underneath and about them,
    and occasionally interlocked with them, huge masses of the prickly
    pears, and beautiful and tempting wild flowers that sweetened the
    atmosphere above; whilst an occasional huge yellow rattlesnake, or
    a copper-head, could be seen gliding over, or basking across their
    vari-coloured tendrils and leaves.</p>

  <p>On the eighth day of our march we met, for the first time, a herd of
    buffaloes; and being in advance of the command, in company with General
    Leavenworth, Colonel Dodge, and several other officers; we all had an
    opportunity of testing the mettle of our horses and <em>our own tact</em>
    at the wild and spirited death. The inspiration of chase took at once,
    and alike, with the old and the young; a beautiful plain lay before us,
    and we all gave spur for the onset. General Leavenworth and Colonel
    Dodge, with their pistols, gallantly and handsomely belaboured a fat
    cow, and were in together at the death. I was not quite so fortunate
    in my selection, for the one which I saw fit to gallant over the plain
    alone, of the same sex, younger and coy, led me a hard chase, and for
    a long time, disputed my near approach; when, at length, the <em>full
    speed</em> of my horse forced us to close company, and she desperately
    assaulted his shoulders with her horns. My gun was aimed, but missing
    its fire, the muzzle entangled in her mane, and was instantly broke
    in two in my hands, and fell over my shoulder. My pistols were then
    brought to bear upon her; and though severely wounded, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> succeeded
    in reaching the thicket and left me without “a deed of chivalry to
    boast.”—Since that day, the Indian hunters in our charge have supplied
    us abundantly with buffalo meat; and report says, that the country
    ahead of us will afford us continual sport, and an abundant supply.</p>

  <p>We are halting here for a few days to recruit horses and men, after
    which the line of march will be resumed; and if the Pawnees are as near
    to us as we have strong reason to believe, from their recent trails and
    fires, it is probable that within a few days we shall “thrash” them or
    “<em>get thrashed</em>;” unless through their sagacity and fear, they
    elude our search by flying before us to their hiding-places.</p>

  <p>The prevailing policy amongst the officers seems to be, that of
    flogging them first, and then establishing a treaty of peace. If this
    plan were <em>morally right</em>, I do not think it <em>practicable</em>;
    for, as <em>enemies</em>, I do not believe they will stand to meet
    us; but, as <em>friends</em>, I think we <em>may</em> bring them to a
    <em>talk</em>, if the proper means are adopted. We are here encamped on
    the ground on which Judge Martin and servant were butchered, and his
    son kidnapped by the Pawnees or Camanchees, but a few weeks since; and
    the moment they discover us in a large body, they will presume that we
    are relentlessly seeking for revenge, and they will probably be very
    shy of our approach. We are over the Washita—the “Rubicon is passed.”
    We are invaders of a sacred soil. We are carrying war in our front,—and
    “we shall soon <em>see</em>, what we <em>shall see</em>.”</p>

  <p>The cruel fate of Judge Martin and family has been published in the
    papers; and it belongs to the regiment of dragoons to demand the
    surrender of the murderers, and get for the information of the world,
    some authentic account of the mode in which this horrid outrage was
    committed.</p>

  <p>Judge Martin was a very respectable and independent man, living on the
    lower part of the Red River, and in the habit of taking his children
    and a couple of black men-servants with him, and a tent to live in,
    every summer, into these wild regions; where he pitched it upon the
    prairie, and spent several months in killing buffaloes and other wild
    game, for his own private amusement. The news came to Fort Gibson but
    a few weeks before we started, that he had been set upon by a party of
    Indians and destroyed. A detachment of troops was speedily sent to the
    spot, where they found his body horridly mangled, and also of one of
    his negroes; and it is supposed that his son, a fine boy of nine years
    of age, has been taken home to their villages by them. Where they still
    retain him, and where it is our hope to recover him.</p>

  <p>Great praise is due to General Leavenworth for his early and unremitted
    efforts to facilitate the movements of the regiment of dragoons, by
    opening roads from Gibson and Towson to this place. We found encamped
    two companies of infantry from Fort Towson, who will follow in the
    rear of the dragoons as far as necessary, transporting with waggons,
    stores and supplies, and ready, at the same time, to co-operate with
    the dragoons in case of necessity. General Leavenworth will advance
    with us from this post, but how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> far he may proceed is uncertain. We
    know not exactly the route which we shall take, for circumstances alone
    must decide that point. We shall probably reach Cantonment Leavenworth
    in the fall; and one thing is <em>certain</em> (in the opinion of one
    who has already seen something of Indian life and country), we shall
    meet with many severe privations and reach that place a jaded set of
    fellows, and as ragged as Jack Falstaff’s famous band.</p>

  <p>You are no doubt inquiring, who are these Pawnees, Camanchees, and
    Arapahoes, and why not tell us all about them? Their history, numbers
    and limits are still in obscurity; nothing definite is yet known of
    them, but I hope I shall soon be able to give the world a clue to them.</p>

  <p>If my life and health are preserved, I anticipate many a pleasing scene
    for my pencil, as well as incidents worthy of reciting to the world,
    which I shall occasionally do, as opportunity may occur.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MOUTH OF FALSE WASHITA.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> I wrote my last Letter from this place, I have been detained here
    with the rest of the cavalcade from the extraordinary sickness which
    is afflicting the regiment, and actually threatening to arrest its
    progress.</p>

  <p>It was, as I wrote the other day, the expectation of the commanding
    officer that we should have been by this time recruited and recovered
    from sickness, and ready to start again on our march; but since I wrote
    nearly one half of the command, and included amongst them, several
    officers, with General Leavenworth, have been thrown upon their backs,
    with the prevailing epidemic, a slow and distressing bilious fever. The
    horses of the regiment are also sick, about an equal proportion, and
    seemingly suffering with the same disease. They are daily dying, and
    men are calling sick, and General Leavenworth has ordered Col. Dodge to
    select all the men, and all the horses that are able to proceed, and be
    off to-morrow at nine o’clock upon the march towards the Camanchees,
    in hopes thereby to preserve the health of the men, and make the most
    rapid advance towards the extreme point of destination.</p>

  <p>General Leavenworth has reserved Col. Kearney to take command of the
    remaining troops and the little encampment; and promises Colonel Dodge
    that he will himself be well enough in a few days to proceed with a
    party on his trail and overtake him at the Cross Timbers.</p>

  <p>I should here remark, that when we started from Fort Gibson, the
    regiment of dragoons, instead of the eight hundred which it was
    supposed it would contain, had only organized to the amount of 400
    men, which was the number that started from that place; and being at
    this time half disabled, furnishes but 200 effective men to penetrate
    the wild and untried regions of the hostile Camanchees. All has been
    bustle and confusion this day, packing up and preparing for the start
    to-morrow morning. My canvass and painting apparatus are prepared and
    ready for the packhorse, which carries the goods and chattels of my
    esteemed companion Joseph Chadwick and myself, and we shall be the two
    only guests of the procession, and consequently the only two who will
    be at liberty to gallop about where we please, despite military rules
    and regulations, chasing the wild herds, or seeking our own amusements
    in any such modes as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> choose. Mr. Chadwick is a young man from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis, with whom I have been long acquainted, and for whom I have the
    highest esteem. He has so far stood by me as a faithful friend, and
    I rely implicitly on his society during this campaign for much good
    company and amusement. Though I have an order from the Secretary at War
    to the commanding officer, to protect and supply me, I shall ask but
    for their protection; as I have, with my friend Joe, laid in our own
    supplies for the campaign, not putting the Government to any expense on
    my account, in pursuit of my own private objects.</p>

  <p>I am writing this under General Leavenworth’s tent, where he has
    generously invited me to take up my quarters during our encampment
    here, and he promises to send it by his express, which starts to-morrow
    with a mail from this to Fort Towson on the frontier, some hundreds of
    miles below this. At the time I am writing, the General lies pallid
    and emaciated before me, on his couch, with a dragoon fanning him,
    whilst he breathes forty or fifty breaths a minute, and writhes under
    a burning fever, although he is yet unwilling even to admit that he is
    sick.</p>

  <p>In my last Letter I gave a brief account of a buffalo chase, where
    General Leavenworth and Col. Dodge took parts, and met with pleasing
    success. The next day, while on the march, and a mile or so in advance
    of the regiment, and two days before we reached this place, General
    Leavenworth, Col. Dodge, Lieut. Wheelock and myself were jogging along,
    and all in turn complaining of the lameness of our bones, from the
    chase on the former day, when the General, who had long ago had his
    surfeit of pleasure of this kind on the Upper Missouri, remonstrated
    against further indulgence, in the following manner: “Well, Colonel,
    this running for buffaloes is bad business for us—we are getting too
    old, and should leave such amusements to the young men; I have had
    enough of this fun in my life, and I am determined not to hazard my
    limbs or weary my horse any more with it—it is the height of folly for
    us, but will do well enough for boys.” Col. Dodge assented at once to
    his resolves, and approved them; whilst I, who had tried it in every
    form (and I had thought, to my heart’s content), on the Upper Missouri,
    joined my assent to the folly of our destroying our horses, which had
    a long journey to perform, and agreed that I would join no more in the
    buffalo chase, however near and inviting they might come to me.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this conversation, and these mutual declarations (or
    rather just at the end of them), as we were jogging along in “<em>Indian
    file</em>,” and General Leavenworth taking the lead, and just rising
    to the top of a little hill over which it seems he had had an instant
    peep, he dropped himself suddenly upon the side of his horse and
    wheeled back! and rapidly informed us with an agitated whisper, and
    an exceeding game contraction of the eye, that a snug little band of
    buffaloes were quietly grazing just over the knoll in a beautiful
    meadow for running, and that if I would take to the left! and Lieut.
    Wheelock to the right! and let him and the Colonel dash right into the
    midst of them! we could play the devil with them!! one half of this
    at least was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> said after he had got upon his feet and taken off his
    portmanteau and valise, in which we had all followed suit, and were
    mounting for the start! and I am almost sure nothing else was said, and
    if it had been I should not have heard it, for I was too far off! and
    too rapidly dashed over the waving grass! and too eagerly gazing and
    plying the whip, to hear or to see, anything but the trampling hoofs!
    and the blackened throng! and the dancing steeds! and the flashing of
    guns! until I had crossed the beautiful lawn! and the limb of a tree,
    as my horse was darting into the timber, had crossed my horse’s back,
    and had scraped me into the grass, from which I soon raised my head!
    and all was silent! and all out of sight! save the dragoon regiment,
    which I could see in distance creeping along on the top of a high
    hill. I found my legs under me in a few moments, and put them in their
    accustomed positions, none of which would for some time, answer the
    usual purpose; but I at last got them to work, and brought “Charley”
    out of the bushes, where he had “brought up” in the top of a fallen
    tree, without damage.</p>

  <p>No buffalo was harmed in this furious assault, nor horse nor rider.
    Col. Dodge and Lieut. Wheelock had joined the regiment, and General
    Leavenworth joined me, with too much game expression <em>yet</em> in his
    eye to allow him more time than to say, “I’ll have that calf before I
    quit!” and away he sailed, “up hill and down dale,” in pursuit of a
    fine calf that had been hidden on the ground during the chase, and was
    now making its way over the prairies in pursuit of the herd. I rode
    to the top of a little hill to witness the success of the General’s
    second effort, and after he had come close upon the little affrighted
    animal, it dodged about in such a manner as evidently to baffle his
    skill, and perplex his horse, which at last fell in a hole, and both
    were instantly out of my sight. I ran my horse with all possible speed
    to the spot, and found him on his hands and knees, endeavouring to get
    up. I dismounted and raised him on to his feet, when I asked him if
    he was hurt, to which he replied “no, but I might have been,” when he
    instantly fainted, and I laid him on the grass. I had left my canteen
    with my portmanteau, and had nothing to administer to him, nor was
    there water near us. I took my lancet from my pocket and was tying his
    arm to open a vein, when he recovered, and objected to the operation,
    assuring me that he was not in the least injured. I caught his horse
    and soon got him mounted again, when we rode on together, and after two
    or three hours were enabled to join the regiment.</p>

  <p>From that hour to the present, I think I have seen a decided change in
    the General’s face; he has looked pale and feeble, and been continually
    troubled with a violent cough. I have rode by the side of him from day
    to day, and he several times told me that he was fearful he was badly
    hurt. He looks very feeble now, and I very much fear the result of the
    fever that has set in upon him.</p>

  <p>We take up the line of march at bugle-call in the morning, and it
    may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> be a long time before I can send a Letter again, as there are no
    post-offices nor mail carriers in the country where we are now going.
    It will take a great deal to stop me from writing, however, and as I
    am now to enter upon one of the most interesting parts of the Indian
    country, inasmuch as it is one of the wildest and most hostile, I shall
    surely scribble an occasional Letter, if I have to carry them in my own
    pocket, and bring them in with me on my return.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">GREAT CAMANCHEE VILLAGE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">We</span> are again at rest, and I am with subjects rude and almost infinite
    around me, for my pen and my brush. The little band of dragoons are
    encamped by a fine spring of cool water, within half a mile of the
    principal town of the Camanchees, and in the midst of a bustling and
    wild scene, I assure you; and before I proceed to give an account of
    things and scenes that are about me, I must return for a few moments to
    the place where I left the Reader, at the encampment at False Washita,
    and rapidly travel with him over the country that lies between that
    place and the Camanchee Village, where I am now writing.</p>

  <p>On the morning after my last Letter was written, the sound and
    efficient part of the regiment was in motion at nine o’clock. And with
    them, my friend “Joe” and I, with our provisions laid in, and all
    snugly arranged on our packhorse, which we alternately led or drove
    between us.</p>

  <p>Our course was about due West, on the divide between the Washita and
    Red Rivers, with our faces looking towards the Rocky Mountains. The
    country over which we passed from day to day, was inimitably beautiful;
    being the whole way one continuous prairie of green fields, with
    occasional clusters of timber and shrubbery, just enough for the uses
    of cultivating-man, and for the pleasure of his eyes to dwell upon.
    The regiment was rather more than half on the move, consisting of
    250 men, instead of 200 as I predicted in my Letter from that place.
    All seemed gay and buoyant at the fresh start, which all trusted was
    to liberate us from the fatal miasma which we conceived was hovering
    about the mouth of the False Washita. We advanced on happily, and
    met with no trouble until the second night of our encampment, in the
    midst of which we were thrown into “pie” (as printers would say,) in
    an instant of the most appalling alarm and confusion. We were encamped
    on a beautiful prairie, where we were every hour apprehensive of
    the lurking enemy. And in the dead of night, when all seemed to be
    sound asleep and quiet, the instant sound and flash of a gun within a
    few paces of us! and then the most horrid and frightful groans that
    instantly followed it, brought us all upon our hands and knees in an
    instant, and our affrighted horses (which were breaking their lasos,)
    in full speed and fury over our heads, with the frightful and mingled
    din of snorting, and cries of “Indians! Indians! Pawnees!” &amp;c., which
    rang from every part of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> little encampment! In a few moments the
    excitement was chiefly over, and silence restored; when we could
    hear the trampling hoofs of the horses, which were making off in all
    directions, (not unlike a drove of swine that once ran into the sea,
    when they were possessed of devils); and leaving but now and then an
    individual quadruped hanging at its stake within our little camp. The
    mode of our encampment was, uniformly in four lines, forming a square
    of fifteen or twenty rods in diameter. Upon these lines our saddles and
    packs were all laid, at the distance of five feet from each other; and
    each man, after grazing his horse, had it fastened with a rope or laso,
    to a stake driven in the ground at a little distance from his feet;
    thus enclosing the horses all within the square, for the convenience of
    securing them in case of attack or alarm. In this way we laid encamped,
    when we were awakened by the alarm that I have just mentioned; and our
    horses affrighted, dashed out of the camp, and over the heads of their
    masters in the desperate “<em>Stampedo</em>.”</p>

  <p>After an instant preparation for battle, and a little recovery from the
    fright, which was soon effected by waiting a few moments in vain, for
    the enemy to come on;—a general explanation took place, which brought
    all to our legs again, and convinced us that there was no decided
    obstacle, as yet, to our reaching the Camanchee towns; and after that,
    “sweet home,” and the arms of our wives and dear little children,
    provided we could ever overtake and recover our horses, which had
    swept off in fifty directions, and with impetus enough to ensure us
    employment for a day or two to come.</p>

  <p>At the proper moment for it to be made, there was a general enquiry
    for the cause of this <em>real misfortune</em>, when it was ascertained
    to have originated in the following manner. A “raw recruit,” who was
    standing as one of the sentinels on that night, saw, as he says “he
    supposed,” an Indian creeping out of a bunch of bushes a few paces in
    front of him, upon whom he levelled his rifle; and as the poor creature
    did not “<em>advance</em> and <em>give the countersign</em>” at his call,
    nor any answer at all, he “let off!” and popped a bullet through the
    heart of a poor dragoon horse, which had strayed away on the night
    before, and had faithfully followed our trail all the day, and was now,
    with a beastly misgiving, coming up, and slowly poking through a little
    thicket of bushes into camp, to join its comrades, in servitude again!</p>

  <p>The sudden shock of a gun, and the most appalling groans of this poor
    dying animal, in the dead of night, and so close upon the heels of
    sweet sleep, created a long vibration of nerves, and a day of great
    perplexity and toil which followed, as we had to retrace our steps
    twenty miles or more, in pursuit of affrighted horses; of which some
    fifteen or twenty took up wild and free life upon the prairies,
    to which they were abandoned, as they could not be found. After a
    detention of two days in consequence of this disaster, we took up the
    line of march again, and pursued our course with vigour and success,
    over a continuation of green fields, enamelled with wild flowers, and
    pleasingly relieved with patches and groves of timber.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>On the fourth day of our march, we discovered many fresh signs of
    buffaloes; and at last, immense herds of them grazing on the distant
    hills. Indian trails were daily growing fresh, and their smokes were
    seen in various directions ahead of us. And on the same day at noon,
    we discovered a large party at several miles distance, sitting on
    their horses and looking at us. From the glistening of the blades of
    their lances, which were blazing as they turned them in the sun, it
    was at first thought that they were Mexican cavalry, who might have
    been apprized of our approach into their country, and had advanced to
    contest the point with us. On drawing a little nearer, however, and
    scanning them closer with our spy-glasses, they were soon ascertained
    to be a war-party of Camanchees, on the look out for their enemies.</p>

  <p>The regiment was called to a halt, and the requisite preparations made
    and orders issued, we advanced in a direct line towards them until
    we had approached to within two or three miles of them, when they
    suddenly disappeared over the hill, and soon after shewed themselves
    on another mound farther off and in a different direction. The course
    of the regiment was then changed, and another advance towards them was
    commenced, and as before, they disappeared and shewed themselves in
    another direction. After several such efforts which proved ineffectual,
    Col. Dodge ordered the command to halt, while he rode forward with a
    few of his staff, and an ensign carrying a white flag. I joined this
    advance, and the Indians stood their ground until we had come within
    half a mile of them, and could distinctly observe all their numbers and
    movements. We then came to a halt, and the white flag was sent a little
    in advance, and waved as a signal for them to approach; at which one of
    their party galloped out in advance of the war-party, on a milk white
    horse, carrying a piece of white buffalo skin on the point of his long
    lance in reply to our flag.</p>

  <p>This moment was the commencement of one of the most thrilling and
    beautiful scenes I ever witnessed. All eyes, both from his own party
    and ours, were fixed upon the manœuvres of this gallant little fellow,
    and he well knew it.</p>

  <p>The distance between the two parties was perhaps half a mile, and that
    a beautiful and gently sloping prairie; over which he was for the space
    of a quarter of an hour, reining and spurring his maddened horse, and
    gradually approaching us by tacking to the right and the left, like a
    vessel beating against the wind. He at length came prancing and leaping
    along till he met the flag of the regiment, when he leaned his spear
    for a moment against it, looking the bearer full in the face, when he
    wheeled his horse, and dashed up to Col. Dodge (<a href="#i_157"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 157</a>),
    with his extended hand, which was instantly grasped and shaken. We
    all had him by the hand in a moment, and the rest of the party seeing
    him received in this friendly manner, instead of being sacrificed,
    as they undoubtedly expected, started under “full whip” in a direct
    line towards us, and in a moment gathered, like a black cloud, around
    us! The regiment then moved up in regular order, and a general shake
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> the hand ensued, which was accomplished by each warrior riding
    along the ranks, and shaking the hand of every one as he passed.
    This necessary form took up considerable time, and during the whole
    operation, my eyes were fixed upon the gallant and wonderful appearance
    of the little fellow who bore us the white flag on the point of his
    lance. He rode a fine and spirited wild horse, which was as white as
    the drifted snow, with an exuberant mane, and its long and bushy tail
    sweeping the ground. In his hand he tightly drew the reins upon a
    heavy Spanish bit, and at every jump, plunged into the animal’s sides,
    till they were in a gore of blood, a huge pair of spurs, plundered, no
    doubt, from the Spaniards in their border wars, which are continually
    waged on the Mexican frontiers. The eyes of this noble little steed
    seemed to be squeezed out of its head; and its fright, and its
    agitation had brought out upon its skin a perspiration that was fretted
    into a white foam and lather. The warrior’s quiver was slung on the
    warrior’s back, and his bow grasped in his left hand, ready for instant
    use, if called for. His shield was on his arm, and across his thigh, in
    a beautiful cover of buckskin, his gun was slung—and in his right hand
    his lance of fourteen feet in length.</p>

  <p>Thus armed and equipped was this dashing cavalier; and nearly in the
    same manner, all the rest of the party; and very many of them leading
    an extra horse, which we soon learned was the favourite war-horse; and
    from which circumstances altogether, we soon understood that they were
    a war-party in search of their enemy.</p>

  <p>After a shake of the hand, we dismounted, and the pipe was lit, and
    passed around. And then a “talk” was held, in which we were aided by
    a Spaniard we luckily had with us, who could converse with one of the
    Camanchees, who spoke some Spanish.</p>

  <p>Colonel Dodge explained to them the friendly motives with which we were
    penetrating their country—that we were sent by the President to reach
    their villages—to see the chiefs of the Camanchees and Pawnee Picts—to
    shake hands with them, and to smoke the pipe of peace, and to establish
    an acquaintance, and consequently a system of trade that would be
    beneficial to both.</p>

  <p>They listened attentively, and perfectly appreciated; and taking
    Colonel Dodge at his word, relying with confidence in what he told
    them; they informed us that their great town was within a few days’
    march, and pointing in the direction—offered to abandon their
    war-excursion, and turn about and escort us to it, which they did in
    perfect good faith. We were on the march in the afternoon of that
    day, and from day to day they busily led us on, over hill and dale,
    encamping by the side of us at night, and resuming the march in the
    morning.</p>

  <p>During this march, over one of the most lovely and picturesque
    countries in the world, we had enough continually to amuse and excite
    us. The whole country seemed at times to be alive with buffaloes, and
    bands of wild horses.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

  <p>We had with us about thirty Osage and Cherokee, Seneca and Delaware
    Indians, employed as guides and hunters for the regiment; and with
    the war-party of ninety or a hundred Camanchees, we formed a most
    picturesque appearance while passing over the green fields, and
    consequently, sad havoc amongst the herds of buffaloes, which we were
    almost hourly passing. We were now out of the influence and reach of
    bread stuffs, and subsisted ourselves on buffaloes’ meat altogether;
    and the Indians of the different tribes, emulous to shew their skill in
    the chase, and prove the mettle of their horses, took infinite pleasure
    in dashing into every herd that we approached; by which means, the
    regiment was abundantly supplied from day to day with fresh meat.</p>

  <p>In one of those spirited scenes when the regiment were on the march,
    and the Indians with their bows and arrows were closely plying a band
    of these affrighted animals, they made a bolt through the line of the
    dragoons, and a complete breach, through which the whole herd passed,
    upsetting horses and riders in the most amusing manner (<a href="#i_158"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    158</a>), and receiving such shots as came from those guns and pistols that
    were <em>aimed</em>, and not fired off into the empty air.</p>

  <p>The buffaloes are very blind animals, and owing, probably in a great
    measure, to the profuse locks that hang over their eyes, they run
    chiefly by the nose, and follow in the tracks of each other, seemingly
    heedless of what is about them; and of course, easily disposed to rush
    in a mass, and the whole tribe or gang to pass in the tracks of those
    that have first led the way.</p>

  <p>The tract of country over which we passed, between the False Washita
    and this place, is stocked, not only with buffaloes, but with numerous
    bands of wild horses, many of which we saw every day. There is no other
    animal on the prairies so wild and so sagacious as the horse; and none
    other so difficult to come up with. So remarkably keen is their eye,
    that they will generally run “at the sight,” when they are a mile
    distant; being, no doubt, able to distinguish the character of the
    enemy that is approaching when at that distance; and when in motion,
    will seldom stop short of three or four miles. I made many attempts
    to approach them by stealth, when they were grazing and playing their
    gambols, without ever having been more than once able to succeed. In
    this instance, I left my horse, and with my friend Chadwick, skulked
    through a ravine for a couple of miles; until we were at length brought
    within gun-shot of a fine herd of them, when I used my pencil for some
    time, while we were under cover of a little hedge of bushes which
    effectually screened us from their view. In this herd we saw all the
    colours, nearly, that can be seen in a kennel of English hounds. Some
    were milk white, some jet black—others were sorrel, and bay, and cream
    colour—many were of an iron grey; and others were pied, containing a
    variety of colours on the same animal. Their manes were very profuse,
    and hanging in the wildest confusion over their necks and faces—and
    their long tails swept the ground (see <a href="#i_160"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 160</a>).</p>

  <p>After we had satisfied our curiosity in looking at these proud and
    playful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> animals, we agreed that we would try the experiment of
    “creasing” one, as it is termed in this country; which is done by
    shooting them through the gristle on the top of the neck, which stuns
    them so that they fall, and are secured with the hobbles on the feet;
    after which they rise again without fatal injury. This is a practice
    often resorted to by expert hunters, with good rifles, who are not
    able to take them in any other way. My friend Joe and I were armed on
    this occasion, each with a light fowling-piece, which have not quite
    the preciseness in throwing a bullet that a rifle has; and having both
    levelled our pieces at the withers of a noble, fine-looking iron grey,
    we pulled trigger, and the poor creature fell, and the rest of the herd
    were out of sight in a moment. We advanced speedily to him, and had the
    most inexpressible mortification of finding, that we never had thought
    of hobbles or halters, to secure him—and in a few moments more, had the
    still greater mortification, and even anguish, to find that one of our
    shots had broken the poor creature’s neck, and that he was quite dead.</p>

  <p>The laments of poor Chadwick for the wicked folly of destroying this
    noble animal, were such as I never shall forget; and so guilty did we
    feel that we agreed that when we joined the regiment, we should boast
    of all the rest of our hunting feats, but never make mention of this.</p>

  <p>The usual mode of taking the wild horses, is, by throwing the
    <em>laso</em>, whilst pursuing them at full speed (<a href="#i_161"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 161</a>),
    and dropping a noose over their necks, by which their speed is soon
    checked, and they are “choked down.” The laso is a thong of rawhide,
    some ten or fifteen yards in length, twisted or braided, with a noose
    fixed at the end of it; which, when the coil of the laso is thrown out,
    drops with great certainty over the neck of the animal, which is soon
    conquered.</p>

  <p>The Indian, when he starts for a wild horse, mounts one of the fleetest
    he can get, and coiling his laso on his arm, starts off under the
    “full whip,” till he can enter the band, when he soon gets it over
    the neck of one of the number; when he instantly dismounts, leaving
    his own horse, and runs as fast as he can, letting the laso pass out
    gradually and carefully through his hands, until the horse falls for
    want of breath, and lies helpless on the ground; at which time the
    Indian advances slowly towards the horse’s head, keeping his laso tight
    upon its neck, until he fastens a pair of hobbles on the animal’s
    two forefeet, and also loosens the laso (giving the horse chance to
    breathe), and gives it a noose around the under jaw, by which he gets
    great power over the affrighted animal, which is rearing and plunging
    when it gets breath; and by which, as he advances, hand over hand,
    towards the horse’s nose (<a href="#i_162"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 162</a>), he is able to hold it
    down and prevent it from throwing itself over on its back, at the
    hazard of its limbs. By this means he gradually advances, until he is
    able to place his hand on the animal’s nose, and over its eyes; and
    at length to breathe in its nostrils, when it soon becomes docile and
    conquered; so that he has little else to do than to remove the hobbles
    from its feet, and lead or ride it into camp.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

  <p>This “breaking down” or taming, however, is not without the most
    desperate trial on the part of the horse, which rears and plunges in
    every possible way to effect its escape, until its power is exhausted,
    and it becomes covered with foam; and at last yields to the power
    of man, and becomes his willing slave for the rest of its life. By
    this very rigid treatment, the poor animal seems to be so completely
    conquered, that it makes no further struggle for its freedom; but
    submits quietly ever after, and is led or rode away with very little
    difficulty. Great care is taken, however, in this and in subsequent
    treatment, not to subdue the spirit of the animal, which is carefully
    preserved and kept up, although they use them with great severity;
    being, generally speaking, cruel masters.</p>

  <p>The wild horse of these regions is a small, but very powerful animal;
    with an exceedingly prominent eye, sharp nose, high nostril, small feet
    and delicate leg; and undoubtedly, have sprung from a stock introduced
    by the Spaniards, at the time of the invasion of Mexico; which having
    strayed off upon the prairies, have run wild, and stocked the plains
    from this to Lake Winnepeg, two or three thousand miles to the North.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>This useful animal has been of great service to the Indians living on
    these vast plains, enabling them to take their game more easily, to
    carry their burthens, &amp;c.; and no doubt, render them better and handier
    service than if they were of a larger and heavier breed. Vast numbers
    of them are also killed for food by the Indians, at seasons when
    buffaloes and other game are scarce. They subsist themselves both in
    winter and summer by biting at the grass, which they can always get in
    sufficient quantities for their food.</p>

  <p>Whilst on our march we met with many droves of these beautiful animals,
    and several times had the opportunity of seeing the Indians pursue
    them, and take them with the laso. The first successful instance of
    the kind was effected by one of our guides and hunters, by the name of
    Beatte, a Frenchman, whose parents had lived nearly their whole lives
    in the Osage village; and who, himself had been reared from infancy
    amongst them; and in a continual life of Indian modes and amusements,
    had acquired all the skill and tact of his Indian teachers, and
    probably a little more; for he is reputed, without exception, the best
    hunter in these Western regions.</p>

  <p>This instance took place one day whilst the regiment was at its usual
    halt of an hour, in the middle of the day.</p>

  <p>When the bugle sounded for a halt, and all were dismounted, Beatte and
    several others of the hunters asked permission of Col. Dodge to pursue
    a drove of horses which were then in sight, at a distance of a mile or
    more from us. The permission was given, and they started off, and by
    following <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>a ravine, approached near to the unsuspecting animals, when
    they broke upon them and pursued them for several miles in full view
    of the regiment. Several of us had good glasses, with which we could
    plainly see every movement and every manœuvre. After a race of two or
    three miles, Beatte was seen with his wild horse down, and the band and
    the other hunters rapidly leaving him.</p>

  <p>Seeing him in this condition, I galloped off to him as rapidly as
    possible, and had the satisfaction of seeing the whole operation of
    “breaking down,” and bringing in the wild animal; and in <a href="#i_162"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    162</a>, I have given a fair representation of the mode by which it was
    done. When he had conquered the horse in this way, his brother, who
    was one of the unsuccessful ones in the chase, came riding back, and
    leading up the horse of Beatte which he had left behind, and after
    staying with us a few minutes, assisted Beatte in leading his conquered
    wild horse towards the regiment, where it was satisfactorily examined
    and commented upon, as it was trembling and covered with white foam,
    until the bugle sounded the signal for marching, when all mounted; and
    with the rest, Beatte, astride of his wild horse, which had a buffalo
    skin girted on its back, and a halter, with a cruel noose around the
    under jaw. In this manner the command resumed its march, and Beatte
    astride of his wild horse, on which he rode quietly and without
    difficulty, until night; the whole thing, the capture, and breaking,
    all having been accomplished within the space of one hour, our usual
    and daily halt at midday.</p>

  <p>Several others of these animals were caught in a similar manner
    during our march, by others of our hunters, affording us satisfactory
    instances of this most extraordinary and almost unaccountable feat.</p>

  <p>The horses that were caught were by no means very valuable specimens,
    being rather of an ordinary quality; and I saw to my perfect
    satisfaction, that the finest of these droves can never be obtained in
    this way, as they take the lead at once, when they are pursued, and in
    a few moments will be seen half a mile or more ahead of the bulk of
    the drove, which they are leading off. There is not a doubt but there
    are many very fine and valuable horses amongst these herds; but it is
    impossible for the Indian or other hunter to take them, unless it be
    done by “creasing” them, as I have before described; which is often
    done, but always destroys the spirit and character of the animal.</p>

  <p>After many hard and tedious days of travel, we were at last told by our
    Camanchee guides that we were near their village; and having led us to
    the top of a gently rising elevation on the prairie, they pointed to
    their village at several miles distance, in the midst of one of the
    most enchanting valleys that human eyes ever looked upon. The general
    course of the valley is from N. W. to S. E., of several miles in width,
    with a magnificent range of mountains rising in distance beyond; it
    being, without doubt, a huge “spur” of the Rocky Mountains, composed
    entirely of a reddish granite or gneiss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> corresponding with the other
    links of this stupendous chain. In the midst of this lovely valley,
    we could just discern amongst the scattering shrubbery that lined the
    banks of the watercourses, the tops of the Camanchee wigwams, and the
    smoke curling above them. The valley, for a mile distant about the
    village, seemed speckled with horses and mules that were grazing in
    it. The chiefs of the war-party requested the regiment to halt, until
    they could ride in, and inform their people who were coming. We then
    dismounted for an hour or so; when we could see them busily running and
    catching their horses; and at length, several hundreds of their braves
    and warriors came out at full speed to welcome us, and forming in a
    line in front of us, as we were again mounted, presented a formidable
    and pleasing appearance (<a href="#i_163"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 163</a>). As they wheeled their
    horses, they very rapidly formed in a line, and “dressed” like
    well-disciplined cavalry. The regiment was drawn up in three columns,
    with a line formed in front, by Colonel Dodge and his staff, in which
    rank my friend Chadwick and I were also paraded; when we had a fine
    view of the whole manœuvre, which was picturesque and thrilling in the
    extreme.</p>

  <p>In the centre of our advance was stationed a white flag, and the
    Indians answered to it with one which they sent forward and planted by
    the side of it.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p>The two lines were thus drawn up, face to face, within twenty or thirty
    yards of each other, as inveterate foes that never had met; and, to the
    everlasting credit of the Camanchees, whom the world had always looked
    upon as murderous and hostile, they had all come out in this manner,
    with their heads uncovered, and without a weapon of any kind, to meet a
    war-party bristling with arms, and trespassing to the middle of their
    country. They had every reason to look upon us as their natural enemy,
    as they have been in the habit of estimating all pale faces; and yet,
    instead of arms or defences, or even of frowns, they galloped out and
    looked us in our faces, without an expression of fear or dismay, and
    evidently with expressions of joy and impatient pleasure, to shake us
    by the hand, on the bare assertion of Colonel Dodge, which had been
    made to the chiefs, that “we came to see them on a friendly visit.”</p>

  <p>After we had sat and gazed at each other in this way for some half an
    hour or so, the head chief of the band came galloping up to Colonel
    Dodge, and having shaken him by the hand, he passed on to the other
    officers in turn, and then rode alongside of the different columns,
    shaking hands with every dragoon in the regiment; he was followed in
    this by his principal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>chiefs and braves, which altogether took up
    nearly an hour longer, when the Indians retreated slowly towards their
    village, escorting us to the banks of a fine clear stream, and a good
    spring of fresh water, half a mile from their village, which they
    designated as a suitable place for our encampment, and we were soon
    bivouacked at the place from which I am now scribbling.</p>

  <p>No sooner were we encamped here (or, in other words, as soon as our
    things were thrown upon the ground,) Major Mason, Lieutenant Wheelock,
    Captain Brown, Captain Duncan, my friend Chadwick and myself, galloped
    off to the village, and through it in the greatest impatience to the
    prairies, where there were at least three thousand horses and mules
    grazing; all of us eager and impatient to see and to appropriate the
    splendid <em>Arabian horses</em>, which we had so often heard were owned
    by the Camanchee warriors. We galloped around busily, and glanced our
    eyes rapidly over them; and all soon returned to the camp, quite “crest
    fallen” and satisfied, that, although there were some tolerable nags
    amongst this medley group of all colours and all shapes, the beautiful
    Arabian we had so often heard of at the East, as belonging to the
    Camanchees, must either be a great ways further South than this, or
    else it must be a <em>horse of the imagination</em>.</p>

  <p>The Camanchee horses are generally small, all of them being of the
    wild breed, and a very tough and serviceable animal; and from what I
    can learn here of the chiefs, there are yet, farther South, and nearer
    the Mexican borders, some of the noblest animals in use of the chiefs,
    yet I do not know that we have any more reason to rely upon this
    information, than that which had made our horse-jockeys that we have
    with us, to run almost crazy for the possession of those we were to
    find at this place. Amongst the immense herds we found grazing here,
    one-third perhaps are mules, which are much more valuable than the
    horses.</p>

  <p>Of the horses, the officers and men have purchased a number of the
    best, by giving a very inferior blanket and butcher’s knife, costing
    in all about four dollars! These horses in our cities at the East,
    independent of the name, putting them upon their merits alone, would be
    worth from eighty to one hundred dollars each, and not more.</p>

  <p>A vast many of such could be bought on such terms, and are hourly
    brought into camp for sale. If we had goods to trade for them, and
    means of getting them home, a great profit could be made, which can
    easily be learned from the following transaction that took place
    yesterday. A fine looking Indian was hanging about my tent very closely
    for several days, and continually scanning an old and half-worn cotton
    umbrella, which I carried over me to keep off the sun, as I was
    suffering with fever and ague, and at last proposed to purchase it of
    me, with a very neat limbed and pretty pied horse which he was riding.
    He proposed at first, that I should give him a knife and the umbrella,
    but as I was not disposed for the trade (the umbrella being so useful
    an article to me, that I did not know how to part with it, not knowing
    whether there was another in the regiment); he came a second time, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>offered me the horse for the umbrella alone, which offer I still
    rejected; and he went back to the village, and soon returned with
    another horse of a much better quality, supposing that I had not valued
    the former one equal to the umbrella.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>100</i></div>
  <figure id="i_163">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_163.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>163</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>With this he endeavoured to push the trade, and after I had with great
    difficulty made him understand that I was sick, and could not part with
    it, he turned and rode back towards the village, and in a short time
    returned again with one of the largest and finest mules I ever saw,
    proposing that, which I also rejected; when he <em>disappeared</em> again.</p>

  <p>In a few moments my friend Captain Duncan, in whose hospitable tent
    I was quartered, came in, and the circumstance being related to him,
    started up some warm jockey feelings, which he was thoroughly possessed
    of, when he instantly sprang upon his feet, and exclaimed, “d——mn the
    fellow! where is he gone? here, Gosset! get my old umbrella out of the
    pack, I rolled it up with my wiper and the <em>frying-pan</em>—get it
    as quick as lightning!” with it in his hand, the worthy Captain soon
    overtook the young man, and escorted him into the village, and returned
    in a short time—not with the mule, but with the second horse that had
    been offered to me.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> There are many very curious traditions about the first
      appearance of horses amongst the different tribes, and many of which
      bear striking proof of the above fact. Most of the tribes have some
      story about the first appearance of horses; and amongst the Sioux, they
      have beautifully recorded the fact, by giving it the name of Shonk
      a-wakon (the medicine-dog).</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> It is a fact which I deem to be worth noting here, that
      amongst all Indian tribes, that I have yet visited, in their primitive,
      as well as improved state, the <em>white flag</em> is used as a flag of
      truce, as it is in the civilized parts of the world, and held to be
      sacred and inviolable. The chief going to war always carries it in some
      form or other, generally of a piece of white skin or bark, rolled on
      a small stick, and carried under his dress, or otherwise; and also a
      red flag, either to be unfurled when occasion requires the <em>white
      flag</em> as a truce, and the <em>red</em> one for battle, or, as they
      say, “for blood.”</div>

  <div class="subheadc">GREAT CAMANCHEE VILLAGE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of the Camanchees by the side of which we are encamped, is
    composed of six or eight hundred skin-covered lodges, made of poles and
    buffalo skins, in the manner precisely as those of the Sioux and other
    Missouri tribes, of which I have heretofore given some account. This
    village with its thousands of wild inmates, with horses and dogs, and
    wild sports and domestic occupations, presents a most curious scene;
    and the manners and looks of the people, a rich subject for the brush
    and the pen.</p>

  <p>In the view I have made of it (<a href="#i_164"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 164</a>), but a small portion
    of the village is shewn; which is as well as to shew the whole of it,
    inasmuch as the wigwams, as well as the customs, are the same in every
    part of it. In the foreground is seen the wigwam of the chief; and in
    various parts, crotches and poles, on which the women are drying meat,
    and “<em>graining</em>” buffalo robes. These people, living in a country
    where buffaloes are abundant, make their wigwams more easily of their
    skins, than of anything else; and with them find greater facilities of
    moving about, as circumstances often require: when they drag them upon
    the poles attached to their horses, and erect them again with little
    trouble in their new residence.</p>

  <p>We white men, strolling about amongst their wigwams, are looked upon
    with as much curiosity as if we had come from the moon; and evidently
    create a sort of chill in the blood of children and dogs, when we make
    our appearance. I was pleased to-day with the simplicity of a group
    which came out in front of the chief’s lodge to scrutinize my faithful
    friend Chadwick and I, as we were strolling about the avenues and
    labyrinths of their village; upon which I took out my book and sketched
    as quick as lightning, whilst “Joe” rivetted their attention by some
    ingenious trick or other, over my shoulders, which I did not see,
    having no time to turn my head (<a href="#i_165"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 165</a>). These were the
    juvenile parts of the chief’s family, and all who at this moment were
    at home; the venerable old man, and his three or four wives, making a
    visit, like hundreds of others, to the encampment.</p>

  <p>In speaking just above, of the mode of moving their wigwams, and
    changing their encampments, I should have said a little more, and
    should also have given to the reader, a sketch of one of these
    extraordinary scenes, which I have had the good luck to witness
    (<a href="#i_166"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 166</a>); where several thousands <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>were on the march,
    and furnishing one of those laughable scenes which daily happen,
    where so many dogs, and so many squaws, are travelling in such a
    confused mass; with so many conflicting interests, and so many local
    and individual rights to be pertinaciously claimed and protected.
    Each horse drags his load, and each dog, <i>i. e.</i> each dog that
    <em>will</em> do it (and there are many that will <em>not</em>), also
    dragging his wallet on a couple of poles; and each squaw with her load,
    and all together (notwithstanding their burthens) cherishing their
    pugnacious feelings, which often bring them into general conflict,
    commencing usually amongst the dogs, and sure to result in fisticuffs
    of the women; whilst the men, riding leisurely on the right or the
    left, take infinite pleasure in overlooking these desperate conflicts,
    at which they are sure to have a laugh, and in which, as sure never to
    lend a hand.</p>

  <p>The Camanchees, like the Northern tribes, have many games, and in
    pleasant weather seem to be continually practicing more or less of
    them, on the prairies, back of, and contiguous to, their village.</p>

  <p>In their ball-plays, and some other games, they are far behind the
    Sioux and others of the Northern tribes; but, in racing horses and
    riding, they are not equalled by any other Indians on the Continent.
    Racing horses, it would seem, is a constant and almost incessant
    exercise, and their principal mode of gambling; and perhaps, a more
    finished set of jockeys are not to be found. The exercise of these
    people, in a country where horses are so abundant, and the country
    so fine for riding, is chiefly done on horseback; and it “stands to
    reason,” that such a people, who have been practicing from their
    childhood, should become exceedingly expert in this wholesome and
    beautiful exercise. Amongst their feats of riding, there is one that
    has astonished me more than anything of the kind I have ever seen, or
    expect to see, in my life:—a stratagem of war, learned and practiced
    by every young man in the tribe; by which he is able to drop his body
    upon the side of his horse at the instant he is passing, effectually
    screened from his enemies’ weapons (<a href="#i_167"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 167</a>) as he lays
    in a horizontal position behind the body of his horse, with his heel
    hanging over the horses back; by which he has the power of throwing
    himself up again, and changing to the other side of the horse if
    necessary. In this wonderful condition, he will hang whilst his horse
    is at fullest speed, carrying with him his bow and his shield, and also
    his long lance of fourteen feet in length, all or either of which he
    will wield upon his enemy as he passes; rising and throwing his arrows
    over the horse’s back, or with equal ease and equal success under the
    horse’s neck.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This astonishing feat which the young men have been
    repeatedly playing off to our surprise as well as amusement, whilst
    they have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>been galloping about in front of our tents, completely
    puzzled the whole of us; and appeared to be the result of magic, rather
    than of skill acquired by practice. I had several times great curiosity
    to approach them, to ascertain by what means their bodies could be
    suspended in this manner, where nothing could be seen but the heel
    hanging over the horse’s back. In these endeavours I was continually
    frustrated, until one day I coaxed a young fellow up within a little
    distance of me, by offering him a few plugs of tobacco, and he in a
    moment solved the difficulty, so far as to render it apparently more
    feasible than before; yet leaving it one of the most extraordinary
    results of practice and persevering endeavours. I found on examination,
    that a short hair halter was passed around under the neck of the horse,
    and both ends tightly braided into the mane, on the withers, leaving
    a loop to hang under the neck, and against the breast, which, being
    caught up in the hand, makes a sling into which the elbow falls, taking
    the weight of the body on the middle of the upper arm. Into this loop
    the rider drops suddenly and fearlessly, leaving his heel to hang over
    the back of the horse, to steady him, and also to restore him when he
    wishes to regain his upright position on the horse’s back.</p>

  <p>Besides this wonderful art, these people have several other feats
    of horsemanship, which they are continually showing off; which are
    pleasing and extraordinary, and of which they seem very proud. A people
    who spend so very great a part of their lives, actually on their
    horses’ backs, must needs become exceedingly expert in every thing that
    pertains to riding—to war, or to the chase; and I am ready, without
    hesitation, to pronounce the Camanchees the most extraordinary horsemen
    that I have seen yet in all my travels, and I doubt very much whether
    any people in the world can surpass them.</p>

  <p>The Camanchees are in stature, rather low, and in person, often
    approaching to corpulency. In their movements, they are heavy and
    ungraceful; and on their feet, one of the most unattractive and
    slovenly-looking races of Indians that I have ever seen; but the
    moment they mount their horses, they seem at once metamorphosed, and
    surprise the spectator with the ease and elegance of their movements. A
    Camanchee on his feet is out of his element, and comparatively almost
    as awkward as a monkey on the ground, without a limb or a branch
    to cling to; but the moment he lays his hand upon his horse, his
    <em>face</em>, even, becomes handsome, and he gracefully flies away like
    a different being.</p>

  <p>Our encampment is surrounded by continual swarms of old and young—of
    middle aged—of male and female—of dogs, and every moving thing that
    constitutes their community; and our tents are lined with the chiefs
    and other worthies of the tribe. So it will be seen there is no
    difficulty of getting subjects enough for my brush, as well as for my
    pen, whilst residing in this place.</p>

  <p>The head chief of this village, who is represented to us here, as the
    head of the nation, is a mild and pleasant looking gentleman, without
    anything striking or peculiar in his looks (<a href="#i_168"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 168</a>);
    dressed in a very humble <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>manner, with very few ornaments upon him,
    and his hair carelessly falling about his face, and over his shoulders.
    The name of this chief is Ee-shah-ko-nee (the bow and quiver). The only
    ornaments to be seen about him were a couple of beautiful shells worn
    in his ears, and a boar’s tusk attached to his neck, and worn on his
    breast.</p>

  <p>For several days after we arrived at this place, there was a huge
    mass of flesh (<a href="#i_168"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 169</a>), Ta-wah-que-nah (the mountain
    of rocks), who was put forward as head chief of the tribe; and all
    honours were being paid to him by the regiment of dragoons, until the
    above-mentioned chief arrived from the country, where it seems he was
    leading a war-party; and had been sent for, no doubt, on the occasion.
    When he arrived, this huge monster, who is the largest and fattest
    Indian I ever saw, stepped quite into the background, giving way to
    this admitted chief, who seemed to have the confidence and respect of
    the whole tribe.</p>

  <p>This enormous man, whose flesh would undoubtedly weigh three hundred
    pounds or more, took the most wonderful strides in the exercise of
    his temporary authority; which, in all probability, he was lawfully
    exercising in the absence of his superior, as second chief of the tribe.</p>

  <p>A perfect personation of Jack Falstaff, in size and in figure, with an
    African face, and a beard on his chin of two or three inches in length.
    His name, he tells me, he got from having conducted a large party of
    Camanchees through a secret and subterraneous passage, entirely through
    the mountain of granite rocks, which lies back of their village;
    thereby saving their lives from their more powerful enemy, who had
    “cornered them up” in such a way, that there was no other possible mode
    for their escape. The mountain under which he conducted them, is called
    <em>Ta-wah-que-nah</em> (the mountain of rocks), and from this he has
    received his name, which would certainly have been far more appropriate
    if it had been a <em>mountain of flesh</em>.</p>

  <p>Corpulency is a thing exceedingly rare to be found in any of the
    tribes, amongst the men, owing, probably, to the exposed and active
    sort of lives they lead; and that in the absence of all the spices of
    life, many of which have their effect in producing this disgusting, as
    well as unhandy and awkward extravagance in civilized society.</p>

  <p>Ish-a-ro-yeh (he who carries a wolf, <a href="#i_170"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 170</a>); and
    Is-sa-wah-tam-ah (the wolf tied with hair, <a href="#i_170"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 171</a>); are
    also chiefs of some standing in the tribe, and evidently men of great
    influence, as they were put forward by the head chiefs, for their
    likenesses to be painted in turn, after their own. The first of the two
    seemed to be the leader of the war-party which we met, and of which I
    have spoken; and in escorting us to their village, this man took the
    lead and piloted us the whole way, in consequence of which Colonel
    Dodge presented him a very fine gun.</p>

  <p>His-oo-san-ches (the Spaniard, <a href="#i_172"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 172</a>), a gallant little
    fellow, is represented to us as one of the leading warriors of the
    tribe; and no doubt is one of the most extraordinary men at present
    living in these regions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> He is half Spanish, and being a half-breed,
    for whom they generally have the most contemptuous feelings, he has
    been all his life thrown into the front of battle and danger; at which
    posts he has signalized himself, and commanded the highest admiration
    and respect of the tribe, for his daring and adventurous career. This
    is the man of whom I have before spoken, who dashed out so boldly from
    the war-party, and came to us with the white flag raised on the point
    of his lance, and of whom I have made a sketch in <a href="#i_157"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 157</a>.
    I have here represented him as he stood for me, with his shield on his
    arm, with his quiver slung, and his lance of fourteen feet in length in
    his right hand. This extraordinary little man, whose figure was light,
    seemed to be all bone and muscle, and exhibited immense power, by the
    curve of the bones in his legs and his arms. We had many exhibitions of
    his extraordinary strength, as well as agility; and of his gentlemanly
    politeness and friendship, we had as frequent evidences. As an instance
    of this, I will recite an occurrence which took place but a few days
    since, when we were moving our encampment to a more desirable ground
    on another side of their village. We had a deep and powerful stream to
    ford, when we had several men who were sick, and obliged to be carried
    on litters. My friend “Joe” and I came up in the rear of the regiment,
    where the litters with the sick were passing, and we found this little
    fellow up to his chin in the muddy water, wading and carrying one
    end of each litter on his head, as they were in turn, passed over.
    After they had all passed, this gallant little fellow beckoned to
    me to dismount, and take a seat on his shoulders, which I declined;
    preferring to stick to my horse’s back, which I did, as he took it by
    the bridle and conducted it through the shallowest ford. When I was
    across, I took from my belt a handsome knife and presented it to him,
    which seemed to please him very much.</p>

  <p>Besides the above-named chiefs and warriors, I painted the portrait
    of <em>Kots-o-ko-ro-ko</em> (the hair of the bull’s neck); and
    <em>Hah-nee</em> (the beaver); the first, a chief, and the second, a
    warrior of terrible aspect, and also of considerable distinction. These
    and many other paintings, as well as manufactures from this tribe, may
    be always seen in my <span class="smcap">Museum</span>, if I have the good luck to get
    them safe home from this wild and remote region.</p>

  <p>From what I have already seen of the Camanchees, I am fully convinced
    that they are a numerous and very powerful tribe, and quite equal in
    numbers and prowess, to the accounts generally given of them.</p>

  <p>It is entirely impossible at present to make a correct estimate of
    their numbers; but taking their own account of villages they point
    to in such numbers, South of the banks of the Red River, as well as
    those that lie farther West, and undoubtedly North of its banks, they
    must be a very numerous tribe; and I think I am able to say, from
    estimates that these chiefs have made me, that they number some 30 or
    40,000—being able to shew some 6 or 7000 warriors, well-mounted and
    well-armed. This estimate I offer not as conclusive, for so little is
    as yet known of these people, that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>no estimate can be implicitly
    relied upon other than that, which, in general terms, pronounces them
    to be a very numerous and warlike tribe.</p>

  <p>We shall learn much more of them before we get out of their country;
    and I trust that it will yet be in my power to give something like a
    fair census of them before we have done with them.</p>

  <p>They speak much of their allies and friends, the Pawnee Picts, living
    to the West some three or four days’ march, whom we are going to visit
    in a few days, and afterwards return to this village, and then “bend
    our course” homeward, or, in other words, back to Fort Gibson. Besides
    the Pawnee Picts, there are the Kiowas and Wicos; small tribes that
    live in the same vicinity, and also in the same alliance, whom we shall
    probably see on our march. Every preparation is now making to be off in
    a few days—and I shall omit further remarks on the Camanchees, until
    we return, when I shall probably have much more to relate of them and
    their customs. So many of the men and officers are getting sick, that
    the little command will be very much crippled, from the necessity we
    shall be under, of leaving about thirty sick, and about an equal number
    of well to take care of and protect them; for which purpose, we are
    constructing a fort, with a sort of breastwork of timbers and bushes,
    which will be ready in a day or two; and the sound part of the command
    prepared to start with several Camanchee leaders, who have agreed to
    pilot the way.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">GREAT CAMANCHEE VILLAGE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> above Letter it will be seen, was written some time ago, and when
    all hands (save those who were too sick) were on the start for the
    Pawnee village. Amongst those exceptions was I, before the hour of
    starting had arrived; and as the dragoons have made their visit there
    and returned in a most jaded condition, and I have again got well
    enough to write, I will render some account of the excursion, which is
    from the pen and the pencil of my friend Joe, who went with them and
    took my sketch and note-books in his pocket.</p>

  <p>“We were four days travelling over a beautiful country, most of the
    way prairie, and generally along near the base of a stupendous range
    of mountains of reddish granite, in many places piled up to an immense
    height without tree or shrubbery on them; looking as if they had
    actually dropped from the clouds in such a confused mass, and all
    lay where they had fallen. Such we found the mountains enclosing the
    Pawnee village, on the bank of Red River, about ninety miles from the
    Camanchee town. The dragoon regiment was drawn up within half a mile
    or so of this village, and encamped in a square, where we remained
    three days. We found here a very numerous village, containing some
    five or six hundred wigwams, all made of long prairie grass, thatched
    over poles which are fastened in the ground and bent in at the top;
    giving to them, in distance, the appearance of straw beehives as in
    <a href="#i_173"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 173</a>, which is an accurate view of it, shewing the Red
    River in front, and the “<em>mountains of rocks</em>” behind it.</p>

  <p>“To our very great surprise, we have found these people cultivating
    quite extensive fields of corn (maize), pumpkins, melons, beans and
    squashes; so, with these aids, and an abundant supply of buffalo meat,
    they may be said to be living very well.</p>

  <p>“The next day after our arrival here, Colonel Dodge opened a council
    with the chiefs, in the chief’s lodge, where he had the most of his
    officers around him. He first explained to them the friendly views
    with which he came to see them; and of the wish of our Government to
    establish a lasting peace with them, which they seemed at once to
    appreciate and highly to estimate.</p>

  <p>“The head chief of the tribe is a very old man, and he several times
    replied <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>to Colonel Dodge in a very eloquent manner; assuring him
    of the friendly feelings of his chiefs and warriors towards the pale
    faces, in the direction from whence we came.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>107</i></div>
  <figure id="i_173">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_173.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>173</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>“After Colonel Dodge had explained in general terms, the objects of our
    visit, he told them that he should expect from them some account of the
    foul murder of Judge Martin and his family on the False Washita, which
    had been perpetrated but a few weeks before, and which the Camanchees
    had told us was done by the Pawnee Picts. The Colonel told them, also,
    that he learned from the Camanchees, that they had the little boy,
    the son of the murdered gentleman, in their possession; and that he
    should expect them to deliver him up, as an indispensable condition of
    the friendly arrangement that was now making. They positively denied
    the fact, and all knowledge of it; firmly assuring us that they knew
    nothing of the murder, or of the boy. The demand was repeatedly made,
    and as often denied; until at length a negro-man was discovered, who
    was living with the Pawnees, who spoke good English; and coming into
    the council-house, gave information that such a boy had recently been
    brought into their village, and was now a prisoner amongst them. This
    excited great surprise and indignation in the council, and Colonel
    Dodge then informed the chiefs that the council would rest here; and
    certainly nothing further of a peaceable nature would transpire until
    the boy was brought in. In this alarming dilemma, all remained in
    gloomy silence for awhile; when Colonel Dodge further informed the
    chiefs, that as an evidence of his friendly intentions towards them,
    he had, on starting, purchased at a very great price, from their
    enemies the Osages, two Pawnee (and one Kiowa) girls; which had been
    held by them for some years as prisoners, and which he had brought the
    whole way home, and had here ready to be delivered to their friends
    and relations; but whom he certainly would never show, until the
    little boy was produced. He also made another demand, which was for
    the restoration of an United States ranger, by the name of Abbé, who
    had been captured by them during the summer before. They acknowledged
    the seizure of this man, and all solemnly declared that he had been
    taken by a party of the Camanchees, over whom they had no controul,
    and carried beyond the Red River into the Mexican provinces, where
    he was put to death. They held a long consultation about the boy,
    and seeing their plans defeated by the evidence of the negro; and
    also being convinced of the friendly disposition of the Colonel, by
    bringing home their prisoners from the Osages, they sent out and had
    the boy brought in, from the middle of a corn-field, where he had been
    secreted. He is a smart and very intelligent boy of nine years of
    age, and when he came in, he was entirely naked, as they keep their
    own boys of that age. There was a great excitement in the council
    when the little fellow was brought in; and as he passed amongst them,
    he looked around and exclaimed with some surprise, “What! are there
    white men here?” to which Colonel Dodge replied, and asked his name;
    and he promptly answered, “my name is Matthew Wright Martin.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> He was
    then received into Colonel Dodge’s arms; and an order was immediately
    given for the Pawnee and Kiowa girls to be brought forward; they were
    in a few minutes brought into the council-house, when they were at
    once recognized by their friends and relatives, who embraced them with
    the most extravagant expressions of joy and satisfaction. The heart
    of the venerable old chief was melted at this evidence of white man’s
    friendship, and he rose upon his feet, and taking Colonel Dodge in his
    arms, and placing his left cheek against the left cheek of the Colonel,
    held him for some minutes without saying a word, whilst tears were
    flowing from his eyes. He then embraced each officer in turn, in the
    same silent and affectionate manner; which form took half an hour or
    more, before it was completed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>“From this moment the council, which before had been a very grave and
    uncertain one, took a pleasing and friendly turn. And this excellent
    old man ordered the women to supply the dragoons with something to eat,
    as they were hungry.</p>

  <p>“The little encampment, which heretofore was in a woeful condition,
    having eaten up their last rations twelve hours before, were now
    gladdened by the approach of a number of women, who brought their
    “back loads” of dried buffalo meat and green corn, and threw it down
    amongst them. This seemed almost like a providential deliverance, for
    the country between here and the Camanchees, was entirely destitute of
    game, and our last provisions were consumed.</p>

  <p>“The council thus proceeded successfully and pleasantly for several
    days, whilst the warriors of the Kiowas and Wicos, two adjoining and
    friendly tribes living further to the West, were arriving; and also a
    great many from other bands of the Camanchees, who had heard of our
    arrival; until two thousand or more of these wild and fearless-looking
    fellows were assembled, and all, from their horses’ backs, with
    weapons in hand, were looking into our pitiful little encampment,
    of two hundred men, all in a state of dependence and almost literal
    starvation; and at the same time nearly one half the number too sick to
    have made a successful resistance if we were to have been attacked.”
    <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * * * * *</span></p>

  <p>The command returned to this village after an absence of fifteen days,
    in a fatigued and destitute condition, with scarcely anything to eat,
    or chance of getting anything here; in consequence of which, Colonel
    Dodge almost instantly ordered preparations to be made for a move to
    the head of the Canadian river, a distance of an hundred or more miles,
    where the Indians represented to us there would be found immense herds
    of buffaloes; a place where we could get enough to eat, and by lying by
    awhile, could restore the sick, who are now occupying a great number of
    litters. Some days have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>elapsed, however, and we are not quite
    ready for the start yet. And during that time, continual parties of the
    Pawnee Picts and Kioways have come up; and also Camanchees, from other
    villages, to get a look at us, and many of them are volunteering to go
    in with us to the frontier.</p>

  <p>The world who know me, will see that I can scarcely be idle under such
    circumstances as these, where so many subjects for my brush and my pen
    are gathering about me.</p>

  <p>The Pawnee Picts, Kioways, and Wicos are the subjects that I am most
    closely scanning at this moment, and I have materials enough around me.</p>

  <p>The Pawnee Picts are undoubtedly a numerous and powerful tribe,
    occupying, with the Kioways and Wicos, the whole country on the head
    waters of the Red River, and quite into and through the southern part
    of the Rocky Mountains. The old chief told me by signs, enumerating
    with his hands and fingers, that they had altogether three thousand
    warriors; which if true, estimating according to the usual rule, one
    warrior to four, would make the whole number about twelve thousand;
    and, allowing a fair per-centage for boasting or bragging, of which
    they are generally a little guilty in such cases, there would be at
    a fair calculation from eight to ten thousand. These then, in an
    established alliance with the great tribe of Camanchees, hunting and
    feasting together, and ready to join in common defence of their country
    become a very formidable enemy when attacked on their own ground.</p>

  <p>The name of the Pawnee Picts, we find to be in their own language,
    Tow-ee-ahge, the meaning of which I have not yet learned. I have
    ascertained also, that these people are in no way related to the
    Pawnees of the Platte, who reside a thousand miles or more North of
    them, and know them only as enemies. There is no family or tribal
    resemblance; nor any in their language or customs. The Pawnees of the
    Platte shave the head, and the Pawnee Picts abominate the custom;
    allowing their hair to grow like the Camanchees and other tribes.</p>

  <p>The old chief of the Pawnee Picts, of whom I have before spoken, and
    whose name is We-ta-ra-sha-ro (<a href="#i_174"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 174</a>), is undoubtedly
    a very excellent and kind-hearted old man, of ninety or more years
    of age, and has consented to accompany us, with a large party of his
    people, to Fort Gibson; where Colonel Dodge has promised to return him
    liberal presents from the Government, for the friendship he has evinced
    on the present occasion.</p>

  <p>The second chief of this tribe, Sky-se-ro-ka (<a href="#i_174"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 175</a>), we
    found to be a remarkably clever man, and much approved and valued in
    his tribe.</p>

  <p>The Pawnee Picts, as well as the Camanchees, are generally a very
    clumsy and ordinary looking set of men, when on their feet; but being
    fine horsemen, are equally improved in appearance as soon as they mount
    upon their horses’ backs.</p>

  <p>Amongst the women of this tribe, there were many that were exceedingly
    pretty in feature and in form; and also in expression, though their
    skins are very dark. The dress of the men in this tribe, as amongst
    the Camanchees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> consists generally in leggings of dressed skins, and
    moccasins; with a flap or breech clout, made also of dressed skins or
    furs, and often very beautifully ornamented with shells, &amp;c. Above the
    waist they seldom wear any drapery, owing to the warmth of the climate,
    which will rarely justify it; and their heads are generally uncovered
    with a head-dress, like the Northern tribes who live in a colder
    climate, and actually require them for comfort.</p>

  <p>The women of the Camanchees and Pawnee Picts, are always decently and
    comfortably clad, being covered generally with a gown or slip, that
    reaches from the chin quite down to the ancles, made of deer or elk
    skins; often garnished very prettily, and ornamented with long fringes
    of elk’s teeth, which are fastened on them in rows, and more highly
    valued than any other ornament they can put upon them.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">plates</span> 176 and 177, I have given the portraits of two
    Pawnee girls, Kah-kee-tsee (the thighs), and She-de-a (wild sage), the
    two Pawnee women who had been held as prisoners by the Osages, and
    purchased by the Indian Commissioner, the Reverend Mr. Schemmerhom, and
    brought home to their own people, and delivered up in the Pawnee town,
    in the manner that I have just described.</p>

  <p>The Kioways are a much finer looking race of men, than either the
    Camanchees or Pawnees—are tall and erect, with an easy and graceful
    gait—with long hair, cultivated oftentimes so as to reach nearly to
    the ground. They have generally the fine and Roman outline of head,
    that is so frequently found at the North,—and decidedly distinct from
    that of the Camanchees and Pawnee Picts. These men speak a language
    distinct from both of the others; and in fact, the Camanchees and
    Pawnee Picts—and Kioways, and Wicos, are all so distinctly different
    in their languages, as to appear in that respect as total strangers to
    each other.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>The head chief of the Kioways, whose name is Teh-toot-sah
    (<a href="#i_178"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 178</a>), we found to be a very gentlemanly and high minded
    man, who treated the dragoons and officers with great kindness while in
    his country. His long hair, which was put up in several large clubs,
    and ornamented with a great many silver broaches, extended quite down
    to his knees. This distinguished man, as well as several others of his
    tribe, have agreed to join us on the march to Fort Gibson; so I shall
    have much of their company yet, and probably much more to say of them
    at a future period. Bon-son-gee (the new fire, <a href="#i_178"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 179</a>) is
    another chief of this tribe, and called a very good man; the principal
    ornaments which he carried on his person were a boar’s tusk and his
    war-whistle, which were hanging on his breast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>Quay-ham-kay (the stone shell, <a href="#i_180"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 180</a>), is another fair
    specimen of the warriors of this tribe; and, if I mistake not, somewhat
    allied to the mysteries and arcana of the healing art, from the
    close company he keeps with my friend Dr. Findley, who is surgeon to
    the regiment, and by whom I have been employed to make a copy of my
    portrait of this distinguished personage.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_180"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 181</a>, Wun-pan-to-mee (the white weasel), a girl; and
    Tunk-aht-oh-ye (the thunderer), a boy; who are brother and sister,
    are two Kioways who were purchased from the Osages, to be taken to
    their tribe by the dragoons. The girl was taken the whole distance
    with us, on horseback, to the Pawnee village, and there delivered to
    her friends, as I have before mentioned; and the fine little boy was
    killed at the Fur Trader’s house on the banks of the Verdigris, near
    Fort Gibson, the day after I painted his portrait, and only a few days
    before he was to have started with us on the march. He was a beautiful
    boy of nine or ten years of age, and was killed by a ram, which struck
    him in the abdomen, and knocking him against a fence, killed him
    instantly.</p>

  <p>Kots-a-to-ah (the smoked shield, <a href="#i_182"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 182</a>), is another of
    the extraordinary men of this tribe, near seven feet in stature, and
    distinguished, not only as one of the greatest warriors, but the
    swiftest on foot, in the nation. This man, it is said, runs down a
    buffalo on foot, and slays it with his knife or his lance, as he runs
    by its side!</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_183"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 183</a>, is the portrait of Ush-ee-kitz (he who fights
    with a feather) head chief of the Wi-co tribe, a very polite and
    polished Indian, in his manners, and remarkable for his mode of
    <em>embracing</em> the officers and others in council.</p>

  <p>In the different talks and councils that we have had with these people,
    this man has been a conspicuous speaker; and always, at the end of
    his speeches, has been in the habit of stepping forward and embracing
    friends and foes, all that were about him, taking each one in turn,
    closely and affectionately in his arms, with his left cheek against
    theirs, and thus holding them tightly for several minutes.</p>

  <p>All the above chiefs and braves, and many others, forming a very
    picturesque cavalcade, will move off with us in a day or two, on our
    way back to Fort Gibson, where it is to be hoped we may arrive more
    happy than we are in our present jaded and sickly condition.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Six</span> days of severe travelling have brought us from the Camanchee
    village to the North bank of the Canadian, where we are snugly encamped
    on a beautiful plain, and in the midst of countless numbers of
    buffaloes; and halting a few days to recruit our horses and men, and
    dry meat to last us the remainder of our journey.</p>

  <p>The plains around this, for many miles, seem actually speckled in
    distance, and in every direction, with herds of grazing buffaloes; and
    for several days, the officers and men have been indulged in a general
    licence to gratify their sporting propensities; and a scene of bustle
    and cruel slaughter it has been, to be sure! From morning till night,
    the camp has been daily almost deserted; the men have dispersed in
    little squads in all directions, and are dealing death to these poor
    creatures to a most cruel and wanton extent, merely for the pleasure
    of <em>destroying</em>, generally without stopping to cut out the meat.
    During yesterday and this day, several hundreds have undoubtedly been
    killed, and not so much as the flesh of half a dozen used. Such immense
    swarms of them are spread over this tract of country; and so divided
    and terrified have they become, finding their enemies in all directions
    where they run, that the poor beasts seem completely bewildered—running
    here and there, and as often as otherwise, come singly advancing to
    the horsemen, as if to join them for their company, and are easily
    shot down. In the turmoil and confusion, when their assailants have
    been pushing them forward, they have galloped through our encampment,
    jumping over our fires, upsetting pots and kettles, driving horses from
    their fastenings, and throwing the whole encampment into the greatest
    instant consternation and alarm. The hunting fever will be satiated in
    a few days amongst the young men, who are well enough to take parts in
    the chase; and the bilious fever, it is to be hoped, will be abated in
    a short time, amongst those who are invalid, and meat enough will be
    dried to last us to Fort Gibson, when we shall be on the march again,
    and wending our way towards that garrison.</p>

  <p>Many are now sick and unable to ride, and are carried on litters
    between two horses. Nearly every tent belonging to the officers has
    been converted to hospitals for the sick; and sighs and groaning are
    heard in all directions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> From the Camanchee village to this place, the
    country has been entirely prairie; and most of the way high and dry
    ground, without water, for which we sometimes suffered very much. From
    day to day we have dragged along exposed to the hot and burning rays of
    the sun, without a cloud to relieve its intensity, or a bush to shade
    us, or anything to cast a shadow, except the bodies of our horses. The
    grass for a great part of the way, was very much dried up, scarcely
    affording a bite for our horses; and sometimes for the distance of
    many miles, the only water we could find, was in stagnant pools, lying
    on the highest ground, in which the buffaloes have been lying and
    wallowing like hogs in a mud-puddle. We frequently came to these dirty
    lavers, from which we drove the herds of wallowing buffaloes, and into
    which our poor and almost dying horses, irresistibly ran and plunged
    their noses, sucking up the dirty and poisonous draught, until, in some
    instances, they fell dead in their tracks—the men also (and oftentimes
    amongst the number, the writer of these lines) sprang from their
    horses, and laded up and drank to almost fatal excess, the disgusting
    and tepid draught, and with it filled their canteens, which were slung
    to their sides, and from which they were sucking the bilious contents
    during the day.</p>

  <p>In our march we found many deep ravines, in the bottoms of which there
    were the marks of wild and powerful streams; but in this season of
    drought they were all dried up, except an occasional one, where we
    found them dashing along in the coolest and clearest manner, and on
    trial, to our great agony, so <em>salt</em> that even our horses could
    not drink from them; so we had occasionally the tantalizing pleasure of
    hearing the roar of, and looking into, the clearest and most sparkling
    streams; and after that the dire necessity of drinking from stagnant
    pools which lay from month to month exposed to the rays of the sun,
    till their waters become so poisonous and heavy, from the loss of their
    vital principle, that they are neither diminished by absorption, or
    taken into the atmosphere by evaporation.</p>

  <p>This poisonous and indigestible water, with the intense rays of the
    sun in the hottest part of the summer, is the cause of the unexampled
    sickness of the horses and men. Both appear to be suffering and dying
    with the same disease, a slow and distressing bilious fever, which
    seems to terminate in a most frightful and fatal affection of the liver.</p>

  <p>In these several cruel days’ march, I have suffered severely, having
    had all the time (and having yet) a distracting fever on me. My real
    friend, Joe, has constantly rode by my side, dismounting and filling my
    canteen for me, and picking up minerals or fossils, which my jaundiced
    eyes were able to discover as we were passing over them; or doing other
    kind offices for me, when I was too weak to mount my horse without
    aid. During this march over these dry and parched plains, we picked up
    many curious things of the fossil and mineral kind, and besides them
    a number of the horned frogs. In our portmanteaux we had a number of
    tin boxes in which we had carried Seidlitz powders, in which we caged
    a number of them safely, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> hopes to carry them home alive. Several
    remarkable specimens my friend Joe has secured of these, with the horns
    of half and three-fourths of an inch in length, and very sharp at the
    points.</p>

  <p>These curious subjects have so often fallen under my eye while on
    the Upper Missouri, that with me, they have lost their novelty in a
    great degree; but they have amused and astonished my friend Chadwick
    so much, that he declares he will take every one he can pick up, and
    make a sensation with them when he gets home. In this way Joe’s fancy
    for horned frogs has grown into a sort of <em>frog-mania</em>, and his
    eyes are strained all day, and gazing amongst the grass and pebbles as
    he rides along, for his precious little prizes, which he occasionally
    picks up and consigns to his pockets.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>On one of these hard day’s march, and just at night, whilst we were
    looking out for water, and a suitable place to encamp, Joe and I
    galloped off a mile or two to the right of the regiment, to a point of
    timber, to look for water, where we found a small and sunken stagnant
    pool; and as our horses plunged their feet into it to drink, we saw to
    our great surprise, a number of frogs hopping across its surface, as
    our horses started them from the shore! Several of them stopped in the
    middle of the pool, sitting quite “high and dry” on the surface of the
    water; and when we approached them nearer, or jostled them, they made a
    leap into the air, and coming down head foremost—went under the water
    and secreted themselves at the bottom. Here was a subject for Joe, in
    his own line! frogs with horns, and frogs with <em>webbed feet</em>,
    that could hop about, and sit upon, the surface of the water! We rode
    around the pool and drove a number of them into it, and fearing that
    it would be useless to try to get one of them that evening; we rode
    back to the encampment, exulting very much in the curious discovery
    we had made for the naturalists; and by relating to some of the
    officers what we had seen, got excessively laughed at for our wonderful
    discovery! Nevertheless, Joe and I could not disbelieve what we had
    seen so distinctly “with our own eyes;” and we took to ourselves (or
    in other words, I acquiesced in Joe’s taking to <em>himself</em>, as it
    was so peculiarly in his line) the most unequivocal satisfaction in
    the curious and undoubted discovery of this new variety; and we made
    our arrangements to ride back to the spot before “<em>bugle call</em>”
    in the morning; and by a thorough effort, to obtain a specimen or two
    of the web-footed frogs for Joe’s pocket, to be by him introduced to
    the consideration of the knowing ones in the East. Well, our horses
    were saddled at an early hour, and Joe and I were soon on the spot—and
    he with a handkerchief at the end of a little pole, with which he had
    made a sort of scoop-net, soon dipped one up as it was hopping along
    on the surface of the water, and making unsuccessful efforts to dive
    through its surface. On examining its feet, we found, to our very great
    surprise, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>that we had taken a great deal of pains to entrap an old
    and familiar little acquaintance of our boyhood; but, somewhat like
    ourselves, unfortunately, from dire necessity, driven to a loathsome
    pool, where the water was so foul and slimy, that it could hop and
    dance about its surface with dry feet; and where it oftentimes found
    difficulty in diving through the surface to hide itself at the bottom.</p>

  <p>I laughed a great deal at poor Joe’s most cruel expense, and we amused
    ourselves a few minutes about this filthy and curious pool, and rode
    back to the encampment. We found by taking the water up in the hollow
    of the hand, and dipping the finger in it, and drawing it over the
    side, thus conducting a little of it out; it was so slimy that the
    whole would run over the side of the hand in a moment!</p>

  <p>We were joked and teased a great deal about our <em>web-footed
    frogs</em>; and after this, poor Joe has had repeatedly to take out and
    exhibit his little pets in his pockets, to convince our travelling
    companions that <em>frogs sometimes actually have horns</em>.</p>

  <p>Since writing the above, an express has arrived from the encampment,
    which we left at the mouth of False Washita, with the melancholy
    tidings of the death of General Leavenworth, Lieutenant M‘Clure, and
    ten or fifteen of the men left at that place! This has cast a gloom
    over our little encampment here, and seems to be received as a fatal
    foreboding by those who are sick with the same disease; and many of
    them, poor fellows, with scarce a hope left now for their recovery.</p>

  <p>It seems that the General had moved on our trail a few days after we
    left the Washita, to the “Cross Timbers,” a distance of fifty or sixty
    miles, where his disease at last terminated his existence; and I am
    inclined to think, as I before mentioned, in consequence of the injury
    he sustained in a fall from his horse when running a buffalo calf. My
    reason for believing this, is, that I rode and ate with him every day
    after the hour of his fall; and from that moment I was quite sure that
    I saw a different expression in his face, from that which he naturally
    wore; and when riding by the side of him two or three days after his
    fall, I observed to him, “General, you have a very bad cough”—“Yes,”
    he replied, “I have killed myself in running that devilish calf; and
    it was a very lucky thing, Catlin, that you painted the portrait of me
    before we started, for it is all that my dear wife will ever see of me.”</p>

  <p>We shall be on the move again in a few days; and I plainly see that
    I shall be upon a litter, unless my horrid fever leaves me, which is
    daily taking away my strength, and almost, at times, my senses. Adieu!</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTER_45">LETTER—<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 45.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">FORT GIBSON, <i>ARKANSAS</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> last Letter was written from my tent, and out upon the wild
    prairies, when I was shaken and <em>terrified</em> by a burning fever,
    with home and my dear wife and little one, two thousand miles ahead of
    me, whom I was despairing of ever embracing again. I am now scarcely
    better off, except that I am in comfortable quarters, with kind
    attendance, and friends about me. I am yet sick and very feeble, having
    been for several weeks upon my back since I was brought in from the
    prairies. I am slowly recovering, and for the first time since I wrote
    from the Canadian, able to use my pen or my brush.</p>

  <p>We drew off from that slaughtering ground a few days after my last
    Letter was written, with a great number sick carried upon litters—with
    horses giving out and dying by the way, which much impeded our progress
    over the long and tedious route that laid between us and Fort Gibson.
    Fifteen days, however, of constant toil and fatigue brought us here,
    but in a most crippled condition. Many of the sick were left by the
    way with attendants to take care of them, others were buried from
    their litters on which they breathed their last while travelling, and
    many others were brought in, to this place, merely to die and get the
    privilege of a decent burial.</p>

  <p>Since the very day of our start into that country, the men have been
    constantly falling sick, and on their return, of those who are alive,
    there are not well ones enough to take care of the sick. Many are
    yet left out upon the prairies, and of those that have been brought
    in, and quartered in the hospital, with the soldiers of the infantry
    regiment stationed here, four or five are buried daily; and as an equal
    number from the 9th regiment are falling by the same disease, I have
    the mournful sound of “Roslin Castle” with muffled drums, passing six
    or eight times a-day under my window, to the burying-ground; which is
    but a little distance in front of my room, where I can lay in my bed
    and see every poor fellow lowered down into his silent and peaceful
    habitation. During the day before yesterday, no less than eight solemn
    processions visited that insatiable ground, and amongst them was
    carried the corpse of my intimate and much-loved friend Lieutenant
    West, who was aid-de-camp to General Leavenworth, on this disastrous
    campaign, and who has left in this place, a worthy and distracted
    widow, with her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> ones to mourn for his untimely end. On the
    same day was buried also the Prussian Botanist, a most excellent and
    scientific gentleman, who had obtained an order from the Secretary at
    War to accompany the expedition for scientific purposes. He had at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis, purchased a very comfortable dearborn waggon, and a snug span
    of little horses to convey himself and his servant with his collection
    of plants, over the prairies. In this he travelled in company with the
    regiment from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis to Fort Gibson some five or six hundred miles
    and from that to the False Washita, and the Cross Timbers and back
    again. In this Tour he had made an immense, and no doubt, very valuable
    collection of plants, and at this place had been for some weeks
    indefatigably engaged in changing and drying them, and at last, fell
    a victim to the disease of the country, which seemed to have made an
    easy conquest of him, from the very feeble and enervated state he was
    evidently in, that of pulmonary consumption. This fine, gentlemanly and
    urbane, excellent man, to whom I became very much attached, was lodged
    in a room adjoining to mine, where he died, as he had lived, peaceably
    and smiling, and that when nobody knew that his life was in immediate
    danger. The surgeon who was attending me, (Dr. Wright,) was sitting on
    my bedside in his morning-call at my room, when a negro boy, who alone
    had been left in the room with him, came into my apartment and said Mr.
    Beyrich was dying—we instantly stepped into his room and found him, not
    in the <em>agonies</em> of death, but quietly breathing his last, without
    a word or a struggle, as he had laid himself upon his bed with his
    clothes and his boots on. In this way perished this worthy man, who had
    no one here of kindred friends to drop tears for him; and on the day
    previous to his misfortune, died also, and much in the same way, his
    devoted and faithful servant, a young man, a native of Germany. Their
    bodies were buried by the side of each other, and a general feeling of
    deep grief was manifested by the officers and citizens of the post,
    in the respect that was paid to their remains in the appropriate and
    decent committal of them to the grave.</p>

  <p>After leaving the head waters of the Canadian, my illness continually
    increased, and losing strength every day, I soon got so reduced that
    I was necessarily lifted on to and off from, my horse; and at last,
    so that I could not ride at all. I was then put into a baggage-waggon
    which was going back empty, except with several soldiers sick, and
    in this condition rode eight days, most of the time in a delirious
    state, lying on the hard planks of the waggon, and made still harder
    by the jarring and jolting, until the skin from my elbows and knees
    was literally worn through, and I almost “<em>worn out</em>;” when we
    at length reached this post, and I was taken to a bed, in comfortable
    quarters, where I have had the skilful attendance of my friend and
    old schoolmate Dr. Wright, under whose hands, thank God, I have been
    restored, and am now daily recovering my flesh and usual strength.</p>

  <p>The experiment has thus been made, of sending an army of men from the
    North, into this Southern and warm climate, in the hottest months of
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> year, of July and August; and from this sad experiment I am sure a
    secret will be learned that will be of value on future occasions.</p>

  <p>Of the 450 fine fellows who started from this place four months since,
    about one-third have already died, and I believe many more there
    are whose fates are sealed, and will yet fall victims to the deadly
    diseases contracted in that fatal country. About this post it seems to
    be almost equally unhealthy, and generally so during this season, all
    over this region, which is probably owing to an unusual drought which
    has been visited on the country, and unknown heretofore to the oldest
    inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Since we came in from the prairies, and the sickness has a little
    abated, we have had a bustling time with the Indians at this place.
    Colonel Dodge sent <em>runners</em> to the chiefs of all the contiguous
    tribes of Indians, with an invitation to meet the Pawnees, &amp;c. in
    council, at this place. Seven or eight tribes flocked to us, in great
    numbers on the first day of the month, when the council commenced;
    it continued for several days, and gave these semi-civilized sons of
    the forest a fair opportunity of shaking the hands of their wild and
    untamed red brethren of the West—of embracing them in their arms, with
    expressions of friendship, and of smoking the calumet together, as the
    solemn pledge of lasting peace and friendship.</p>

  <p>Colonel Dodge, Major Armstrong (the Indian agent), and General Stokes
    (the Indian commissioner), presided at this council, and I cannot name
    a scene more interesting and entertaining than it was; where, for
    several days in succession, free vent was given to the feelings of
    men <em>civilized</em>, <em>half-civilized</em>, and <em>wild</em>; where
    the three stages of man were fearlessly asserting their rights, their
    happiness, and friendship for each other. The vain orations of the
    half-polished (and half-breed) Cherokees and Choctaws, with all their
    finery and art, found their match in the brief and jarring gutturals of
    the wild and naked man.</p>

  <p>After the council had adjourned, and the fumes of the peace-making
    calumet had vanished away, and Colonel Dodge had made them additional
    presents, they soon made preparations for their departure, and on
    the next day started, with an escort of dragoons, for their own
    country. This movement is much to be regretted; for it would have been
    exceedingly gratifying to the people of the East to have seen so wild a
    group, and it would have been of great service to them to have visited
    Washington—a journey, though, which they could not be prevailed upon to
    make.</p>

  <p>We brought with us to this place, three of the principal chiefs of
    the Pawnees, fifteen Kioways, one Camanchee, and one Wi-co chief. The
    group was undoubtedly one of the most interesting that ever visited our
    frontier; and, I have taken the utmost pains in painting the portraits
    of all of them, as well as seven of the Camanchee chiefs, who came part
    of the way with us, and turned back. These portraits, together with
    other paintings which I have made, descriptive of their manners and
    customs—views of their villages—landscapes of the country, &amp;c., will
    soon be laid before the amateurs of the East, and, I trust, will be
    found to be very interesting.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

  <p>Although the achievement has been a handsome one, of bringing these
    unknown people to an acquaintance, and a general peace; and at first
    sight would appear to be of great benefit to them—yet I have my strong
    doubts, whether it will better their condition, unless with the
    exercised aid of the strong arm of Government, they can be protected in
    the rights which by nature, they are entitled to.</p>

  <p>There is already in this place a company of eighty men fitted out, who
    are to start to-morrow, to overtake these Indians a few miles from
    this place, and accompany them home, with a large stock of goods, with
    traps for catching beavers, &amp;c., calculating to build a trading-house
    amongst them, where they will amass, at once, an immense fortune, being
    the first traders and trappers that have ever been in that part of the
    country.</p>

  <p>I have travelled too much among Indian tribes, and seen too much, not
    to know the evil consequences of such a system. Goods are sold at
    such exorbitant prices, that the Indian gets a mere shadow for his
    peltries, &amp;c. The Indians see no white people but traders and sellers
    of whiskey; and of course, judge us all by them—they consequently
    hold us, and always will, in contempt; as inferior to themselves, as
    they have reason to do—and they neither fear nor respect us. When,
    on the contrary, if the Government would promptly prohibit such
    establishments, and invite these Indians to our frontier posts, they
    would bring in their furs, their robes, horses, mules, &amp;c., to this
    place, where there is a good market for them all—where they would
    get the full value of their property—where there are several stores
    of goods—where there is an honourable competition, and where they
    would get four or five times as much for their articles of trade,
    as they would get from a trader in the village, out of the reach of
    competition, and out of sight of the civilized world.</p>

  <p>At the same time, as they would be continually coming where they
    would see good and polished society, they would be gradually adopting
    our modes of living—introducing to their country our vegetables,
    our domestic animals, poultry, &amp;c., and at length, our arts and
    manufactures; they would see and estimate our military strength, and
    advantages, and would be led to fear and respect us. In short, it would
    undoubtedly be the quickest and surest way to a general acquaintance—to
    friendship and peace, and at last to civilization. If there is a law in
    existence for such protection of the Indian tribes, which may have been
    waived in the case of those nations with which we have long traded, it
    is a great pity that it should not be rigidly enforced in this new and
    important acquaintance, which we have just made with thirty or forty
    thousand strangers to the civilized world; yet (as we have learned from
    their unaffected hospitality when in their villages), with hearts of
    human mould, <em>susceptible</em> of all the noble feelings belonging to
    civilized man.</p>

  <p>This acquaintance has cost the United States a vast sum of money, as
    well as the lives of several valuable and esteemed officers and more
    than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> 100 of the dragoons; and for the honour of the American name, I
    think we ought, in forming an acquaintance with these numerous tribes,
    to adopt and <em>enforce</em> some different system from that which has
    been generally practiced on and beyond our frontiers heretofore.</p>

  <p>What the regiment of dragoons has suffered from sickness since they
    started on their summer’s campaign is unexampled in this country, and
    almost incredible.—When we started from this place, ten or fifteen were
    sent back the first day, too sick to proceed; and so afterwards our
    numbers were daily diminished, and at the distance of 200 miles from
    this place we could muster, out of the whole regiment, but 250 men who
    were able to proceed, with which little band, and that again reduced
    some sixty or seventy by sickness, we pushed on, and accomplished
    all that was done. The beautiful and pictured scenes which we passed
    over had an alluring charm on their surface, but (as it would seem)
    a lurking poison within, that spread a gloom about our encampment
    whenever we pitched it.</p>

  <p>We sometimes rode day after day, without a tree to shade us from the
    burning rays of a tropical sun, or a breath of wind to regale us or
    cheer our hearts—and with mouths continually parched with thirst, we
    dipped our drink from stagnant pools that were heated by the sun, and
    kept in fermentation by the wallowing herds of buffaloes that resort
    to them. In this way we dragged on, sometimes passing picturesque and
    broken country, with fine springs and streams, affording us the luxury
    of a refreshing shade and a cool draught of water.</p>

  <p>Thus was dragged through and completed this most disastrous campaign;
    and to Colonel Dodge and Colonel Kearney, who so indefatigably led and
    encouraged their men through it, too much praise cannot be awarded.</p>

  <p>During my illness while I have been at this post, my friend Joe has
    been almost constantly by my bedside; evincing (as he did when we were
    creeping over the vast prairies) the most sincere and intense anxiety
    for my recovery; whilst he has administered, like a brother, every aid
    and every comfort that lay in his power to bring. Such tried friendship
    as this, I shall ever recollect; and it will long hence and often, lead
    my mind back to retrace, at least, the first part of our campaign,
    which was full pleasant; and many of its incidents have formed pleasing
    impressions on my memory, which I would preserve to the end of my life.</p>

  <p>When we started, we were fresh and ardent for the incidents that
    were before us—our little packhorse carried our bedding and culinary
    articles; amongst which we had a coffee-pot and a frying-pan—coffee in
    good store, and sugar—and wherever we spread our bear-skin, and kindled
    our fire in the grass, we were sure to take by ourselves, a delightful
    repast, and a refreshing sleep. During the march, as we were subject to
    no military subordination, we galloped about wherever we were disposed,
    popping away at whatever we chose to spend ammunition upon—and running
    our noses into every wild nook and crevice, as we saw fit. In this way
    we travelled happily, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> our coffee was gone, and our bread; and
    even then we were happy upon meat alone, until at last each one in his
    turn, like every other moving thing about us, both man and beast, were
    vomiting and fainting, under the poisonous influence of some latent
    enemy, that was floating in the air, and threatening our destruction.
    Then came the “tug of war,” and instead of catering for our amusements,
    every one seemed desperately studying the means that were to support
    him on his feet, and bring him safe home again to the bosoms of his
    friends. In our start, our feelings were buoyant and light, and we had
    the luxuries of life—the green prairies, spotted with wild flowers, and
    the clear blue sky, were an earthly paradise to us, until fatigue and
    disease, and at last despair, made them tiresome and painful to our
    jaundiced eyes.</p>

  <p>On our way, and while we were in good heart, my friend Joe and I had
    picked up many minerals and fossils of an interesting nature, which
    we put in our portmanteaux and carried for weeks, with much pains,
    and some <em>pain</em> also, until the time when our ardour cooled
    and our spirits lagged, and then we discharged and threw them away;
    and sometimes we came across specimens again, still more wonderful,
    which we put in their place, and lugged along till we were tired of
    <em>them</em>, and their weight, and we discharged them as before; so
    that from our eager desire to procure, we lugged many pounds weight
    of stones, shells, &amp;c. nearly the whole way, and were glad that their
    mother Earth should receive them again at our hands, which was done
    long before we got back.</p>

  <p>One of the most curious places we met in all our route, was a
    mountain ridge of fossil shells, from which a great number of the
    above-mentioned specimens were taken. During our second day’s march
    from the mouth of the False Washita, we were astonished to find
    ourselves travelling over a bed of clam and oyster shells, which were
    all in a complete state of petrifaction. This ridge, which seemed to
    run from N.E. to S.W. was several hundred feet high, and varying from a
    quarter to half a mile in breadth, seemed to be composed of nothing but
    a concretion of shells, which, on the surface, exposed to the weather
    for the depth of eight or ten inches, were entirely separated from the
    cementing material which had held them together, and were lying on the
    surface, sometimes for acres together, without a particle of soil or
    grass upon them; with the colour, shapes and appearance exactly, of the
    natural shells, lying loosely together, into which our horses’ feet
    were sinking at every step, above their fetterlocks. These I consider
    the most extraordinary petrifactions I ever beheld. In any way they
    could be seen, individually or in the mass together, they seemed to be
    nothing but the <em>pure shells themselves</em>, both in colour and in
    shape. In many instances we picked them up entire, never having been
    opened; and taking our knives out, and splitting them open as we would
    an oyster, the fish was seen petrified in perfect form, and by dipping
    it into water, it shewed all the colours and freshness of an oyster
    just opened and laid on a plate to be eaten. Joe and I had carefully
    tied up many of these, with which we felt quite sure we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> deceive
    our oyster-eating friends when we got back to the East; yet, like many
    other things we collected, they shared the fate that I have mentioned,
    without our bringing home one of them, though we brought many of them
    several hundreds of miles, and at last threw them away. This remarkable
    ridge is in some parts covered with grass, but generally with mere
    scattering bunches, for miles together, partially covering this compact
    mass of shells, forming (in my opinion) one of the greatest geological
    curiosities now to be seen in this country, as it lies evidently some
    thousands of feet above the level of the ocean, and seven or eight
    hundred miles from the nearest point on the sea-coast.</p>

  <p>In another section of the country, lying between Fort Gibson and the
    Washita, we passed over a ridge for several miles, running parallel to
    this, where much of the way there was no earth or grass under foot, but
    our horses were travelling on a solid rock, which had on its surface
    a reddish or oxidized appearance; and on getting from my horse and
    striking it with my hatchet, I found it to contain sixty or eighty per
    cent of solid iron, which produced a ringing noise, and a rebounding of
    the hatchet, as if it were struck upon an anvil.</p>

  <p>In other parts, and farther West, between the Camanchee village and the
    Canadian, we passed over a similar surface for many miles denuded, with
    the exception of here and there little bunches of grass and wild sage,
    a level and exposed surface of solid gypsum, of a dark grey colour: and
    through it, occasionally, as far as the eye could discover, to the East
    and the West streaks of three and five inches wide of snowy gypsum,
    which was literally as white as the drifted snow.</p>

  <p>Of saltpetre and salt, there are also endless supplies; so it will
    be seen that the mineral resources of this wilderness country are
    inexhaustible and rich, and that the idle savage who never converts
    them to his use, must soon yield them to the occupation of enlightened
    and cultivating man.</p>

  <p>In the vicinity of this post there are an immense number of Indians,
    most of whom have been removed to their present locations by the
    Government, from their Eastern original positions, within a few
    years past; and previous to my starting with the dragoons, I had two
    months at my leisure in this section of the country, which I used
    in travelling about with my canvass and note-book, and visiting all
    of them in their villages. I have made many paintings amongst them,
    and have a curious note-book to open at a future day, for which the
    reader may be prepared. The tribes whom I thus visited, and of whom my
    note-book will yet speak, are the <em>Cherokees</em>, <em>Choctaws</em>,
    <em>Creeks</em>, <em>Seminoles</em>, <em>Chickasaws</em>, <em>Quapaws</em>,
    <em>Senecas</em>, <em>Delawares</em>, and several others, whose customs are
    interesting, and whose history, from their proximity to, and dealings
    with the civilized community, is one of great interest, and some
    importance, to the enlightened world. Adieu.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="subheadc">ALTON, <i>ILLINOIS</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the date of the above Letter, I took leave of Fort
    Gibson, and made a transit across the prairies to this place, a
    distance of 550 miles, which I have performed entirely alone, and had
    the satisfaction of joining my wife, whom I have found in good health,
    in a family of my esteemed friends, with whom she has been residing
    during my last year of absence.</p>

  <p>While at Fort Gibson, on my return from the Camanchees, I was quartered
    for a month or two in a room with my fellow-companion in misery,
    Captain Wharton, of the dragoons, who had come in from the prairies in
    a condition very similar to mine, and laid in a bed in the opposite
    corner of the room; where we laid for several weeks, like two grim
    ghosts, rolling our glaring and staring eye-balls upon each other, when
    we were totally unable to hold converse, other than that which was
    exchanged through the expressive language of our hollow, and bilious,
    sunken eyes.</p>

  <p>The Captain had been sent with a company of dragoons to escort the
    Santa Fee Traders through the country of the Camanchees and Pawnees,
    and had returned from a rapid and bold foray into the country, with
    many of his men sick, and himself attacked with the epidemic of the
    country. The Captain is a gentleman of high and noble bearing, of
    one of the most respected families in Philadelphia, with a fine and
    chivalrous feeling; but with scarce physical stamina sufficient to bear
    him up under the rough vicissitudes of his wild and arduous sort of
    life in this country.</p>

  <p>As soon as our respective surgeons had clarified our flesh and our
    bones with calomel, had brought our pulses to beat calmly, our tongues
    to ply gently, and our stomachs to digest moderately; we began to feel
    pleasure exquisitely in our convalescence, and draw amusement from
    mutual relations of scenes and adventures we had witnessed on our
    several marches. The Captain convalescing faster than I did, soon got
    so as to eat (but not to digest) enormous meals, which visited back
    upon him the renewed horrors of his disease; and I, who had got ahead
    of him in strength, but not in prudence, was thrown back in my turn,
    by similar indulgence; and so we were mutually and repeatedly, until
    he at length got so as to feel strength enough to ride, and resolution
    enough to swear that he would take leave of that deadly spot, and seek
    restoration and health in a cooler and more congenial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> latitude. So he
    had his horse brought up one morning, whilst he was so weak that he
    could scarcely mount upon its back, and with his servant, a small negro
    boy, packed on another, he steered off upon the prairies towards Fort
    Leavenworth, 500 miles to the North, where his company had long since
    marched.</p>

  <p>I remained a week or two longer, envying the Captain the good luck to
    escape from that dangerous ground; and after I had gained strength
    sufficient to warrant it, I made preparations to take informal leave,
    and wend <em>my</em> way also over the prairies to the Missouri, a
    distance of 500 miles, and most of the way a solitary wilderness. For
    this purpose I had my horse “Charley” brought up from his pasture,
    where he had been in good keeping during my illness, and got so fat as
    to form almost an objectionable contrast to his master, with whom he
    was to embark on a long and tedious journey again, over the vast and
    almost boundless prairies.</p>

  <p>I had, like the Captain, grown into such a dread of that place, from
    the scenes of death that were and had been visited upon it, that I
    resolved to be off as soon as I had strength to get on to my horse, and
    balance myself upon his back. For this purpose I packed up my canvass
    and brushes, and other luggage, and sent them down the river to the
    Mississippi, to be forwarded by steamer, to meet me at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis. So,
    one fine morning, Charley was brought up and saddled, and a bear-skin
    and a buffalo robe being spread upon his saddle, and a coffee-pot
    and tin cup tied to it also—with a few pounds of hard biscuit in my
    portmanteau—with my fowling-piece in my hand, and my pistols in my
    belt—with my sketch-book slung on my back, and a small pocket compass
    in my pocket; I took leave of Fort Gibson, even against the advice of
    my surgeon and all the officers of the garrison, who gathered around me
    to bid me farewell. No argument could contend with the fixed resolve
    in my own mind, that if I could get out upon the prairies, and moving
    continually to the Northward, I should daily gain strength, and save
    myself, possibly, from the jaws of that voracious burial-ground that
    laid in front of my room; where I had for months laid and imagined
    myself going with other poor fellows, whose mournful dirges were
    played under my window from day to day. No one can imagine what was
    the dread I felt for that place; nor the pleasure, which was extatic,
    when Charley was trembling under me, and I turned him around on the top
    of a prairie bluff at a mile distance, to take the last look upon it,
    and thank God, as I did audibly, that I was not to be buried within
    its enclosure. I said to myself, that “to die on the prairie, and be
    devoured by wolves; or to fall in combat and be scalped by an Indian,
    would be far more acceptable than the lingering death that would
    consign me to the jaws of that insatiable grave,” for which, in the
    fever and weakness of my mind, I had contracted so destructive a terror.</p>

  <p>So, alone, without other living being with me than my affectionate
    horse Charley, I turned my face to the North, and commenced on my long
    journey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> with confidence full and strong, that I should gain strength
    daily; and no one can ever know the pleasure of that moment, which
    placed me alone, upon the boundless sea of waving grass, over which my
    proud horse was prancing, and I with my life in my own hands, commenced
    to steer my course to the banks of the Missouri.</p>

  <p>For the convalescent, rising and escaping from the gloom and horrors
    of a sick bed, astride of his strong and trembling horse, carrying him
    fast and safely over green fields spotted and tinted with waving wild
    flowers; and through the fresh and cool breezes that are rushing about
    him, as he daily shortens the distance that lies between him and his
    wife and little ones, there is an exquisite pleasure yet to be learned,
    by those who never have felt it.</p>

  <p>Day by day I thus pranced and galloped along, the whole way through
    waving grass and green fields, occasionally dismounting and lying in
    the grass an hour or so, until the grim shaking and chattering of
    an ague chill had passed off; and through the nights, slept on my
    bear-skin spread upon the grass, with my saddle for my pillow, and
    my buffalo robe drawn over me for my covering. My horse Charley was
    picketed near me at the end of his laso, which gave him room for his
    grazing; and thus we snored and nodded away the nights, and never were
    denied the doleful serenades of the gangs of sneaking wolves that were
    nightly perambulating our little encampment, and stationed at a safe
    distance from us at sunrise in the morning—gazing at us, and impatient
    to pick up the crumbs and bones that were left, when we moved away
    from our feeble fire that had faintly flickered through the night,
    and in the absence of timber, had been made of dried buffalo dung,
    (<a href="#i_184"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 184</a>).</p>

  <p>This “<em>Charley</em>” was a noble animal of the Camanchee wild breed,
    of a clay bank colour; and from our long and tried acquaintance, we
    had become very much attached to each other, and acquired a wonderful
    facility both of mutual accommodation, and of construing each other’s
    views and intentions. In fact, we had been so long tried together,
    that there would have seemed to the spectator almost an unity of
    <em>interest</em>; and at all events, an unity of feelings on the subject
    of attachment, as well as on that of mutual dependence and protection.</p>

  <p>I purchased this very showy and well-known animal of Colonel Burbank,
    of the ninth regiment, and rode it the whole distance to the Camanchee
    villages and back again; and at the time when most of the horses of
    the regiment were drooping and giving out by the way—<em>Charley</em>
    flourished and came in in good flesh and good spirits.</p>

  <p>On this journey, while he and I were twenty-five days alone, we had
    much time, and the best of circumstances, under which to learn what we
    had as yet overlooked in each other’s characters, as well as to draw
    great pleasure and real benefit from what we already had learned of
    each other in our former travels.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

  <p>I generally halted on the bank of some little stream, at half an hour’s
    sun, where feed was good for Charley, and where I could get wood to
    kindle my fire, and water for my coffee. The first thing was to undress
    “Charley” and drive down his picket, to which he was fastened, to graze
    over a circle that he could inscribe at the end of his laso. In this
    wise he busily fed himself until nightfall; and after my coffee was
    made and drank, I uniformly moved him up, with his picket by my head,
    so that I could lay my hand upon his laso in an instant, in case of any
    alarm that was liable to drive him from me. On one of these evenings
    when he was grazing as usual, he slipped the laso over his head, and
    deliberately took his supper at his pleasure, wherever he chose to
    prefer it, as he was strolling around. When night approached, I took
    the laso in hand and endeavoured to catch him, but I soon saw that he
    was determined to enjoy a little freedom; and he continually evaded
    me until dark, when I abandoned the pursuit, making up my mind that I
    should inevitably lose him, and be obliged to perform the rest of my
    journey on foot. He had led me a chase of half a mile or more, when I
    left him busily grazing, and returned to my little solitary bivouac,
    and laid myself on my bear skin, and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night I waked, whilst I was lying on my back, and
    on half opening my eyes, I was instantly shocked to the soul, by the
    huge figure (as I thought) of an Indian, standing over me, and in the
    very instant of taking my scalp! The chill of horror that paralyzed me
    for the first moment, held me still till I saw there was no need of
    my moving—that my faithful horse “Charley” had “played shy” till he
    had “filled his belly,” and had then moved up, from feelings of pure
    affection, or from instinctive fear, or possibly, from a due share of
    both, and taken his position with his forefeet at the edge of my bed,
    with his head hanging directly over me, while he was standing fast
    asleep!</p>

  <p>My nerves, which had been most violently shocked, were soon quieted,
    and I fell asleep, and so continued until sunrise in the morning, when
    I waked, and beheld my faithful servant at some considerable distance,
    busily at work picking up his breakfast amongst the cane-brake, along
    the bank of the creek. I went as busily to work, preparing my own,
    which was eaten, and after it, I had another half-hour of fruitless
    endeavours to catch Charley, whilst he seemed mindful of success on
    the evening before, and continually tantalized me by turning around
    and around, and keeping out of my reach. I recollected the conclusive
    evidence of his attachment and dependence, which he had voluntarily
    given in the night, and I thought I would try them in another way. So
    I packed up my things and slung the saddle on my back, trailing my gun
    in my hand, and started on my route. After I had advanced a quarter
    of a mile, I looked back, and saw him standing with his head and tail
    very high, looking alternately at me and at the spot where I had been
    encamped, and left a little fire burning. In this condition he stood
    and surveyed the prairies around for a while, as I continued on.
    He, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>at length, walked with a hurried step to the spot, and seeing
    everything gone, began to neigh very violently, and at last started off
    at fullest speed, and overtook me, passing within a few paces of me,
    and wheeling about at a few rods distance in front of me, trembling
    like an aspen leaf.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>111</i></div>
  <figure id="i_184">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>184</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>I called him by his familiar name, and walked up to him with the bridle
    in my hand, which I put over his head, as he held it down for me, and
    the saddle on his back, as he actually stooped to receive it. I was
    soon arranged, and on his back, when he started off upon his course as
    if he was well contented and pleased, like his rider, with the manœuvre
    which had brought us together again, and afforded us mutual relief
    from our awkward positions. Though this alarming freak of “Charley’s”
    passed off and terminated so satisfactorily; yet I thought such rather
    dangerous ones to play, and I took good care after that night, to keep
    him under my strict authority; resolving to avoid further tricks and
    experiments till we got to the land of cultivated fields and steady
    habits.</p>

  <p>On the night of this memorable day, Charley and I stopped in one of the
    most lovely little valleys I ever saw, and even far more beautiful than
    could have been <em>imagined</em> by mortal man. An enchanting little
    lawn of five or six acres, on the banks of a cool and rippling stream,
    that was alive with fish; and every now and then, a fine brood of young
    ducks, just old enough for delicious food, and too unsophisticated
    to avoid an easy and simple death. This little lawn was surrounded
    by bunches and copses of the most luxuriant and picturesque foliage,
    consisting of the lofty bois d’arcs and elms, spreading out their huge
    branches, as if offering protection to the rounded groups of cherry and
    plum-trees that supported festoons of grapevines, with their purple
    clusters that hung in the most tempting manner over the green carpet
    that was everywhere decked out with wild flowers, of all tints and of
    various sizes, from the modest wild sun-flowers, with their thousand
    tall and drooping heads, to the lillies that stood, and the violets
    that crept beneath them. By the side of this cool stream, Charley was
    fastened, and near him my bear-skin was spread in the grass, and by it
    my little fire, to which I soon brought a fine string of perch from the
    brook; from which, and a broiled duck, and a delicious cup of coffee,
    I made my dinner and supper, which were usually united in one meal,
    at half an hour’s sun. After this I strolled about this sweet little
    paradise, which I found was chosen, not only by myself, but by the wild
    deer, which were repeatedly rising from their quiet lairs, and bounding
    out, and over the graceful swells of the prairies which hemmed in, and
    framed this little picture of sweetest tints and most masterly touches.</p>

  <p>The Indians also, I found, had loved it once, and left it; for here
    and there were their solitary and deserted graves, which told, though
    briefly, of former chaunts and sports; and perhaps, of wars and deaths,
    that have once rung and echoed through this little silent vale.</p>

  <p>On my return to my encampment, I laid down upon my back, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> looked
    awhile into the blue heavens that were over me, with their pure
    and milk white clouds that were passing—with the sun just setting
    in the West, and the silver moon rising in the East, and renewed
    the impressions of my own insignificance, as I contemplated the
    incomprehensible mechanism of that <em>wonderful clock</em>, whose time
    is infallible, and whose motion is eternity! I trembled, at last, at
    the dangerous expanse of my thoughts, and turned them again, and my
    eyes, upon the little and more comprehensible things that were about
    me. One of the first was a <em>newspaper</em>, which I had brought from
    the Garrison, the National Intelligencer, of Washington, which I had
    read for years, but never with quite the zest and relish that I now
    conversed over its familiar columns, in this clean and sweet valley of
    dead silence!</p>

  <p>And while reading, I thought of (and laughed), what I had almost
    forgotten, the sensation I produced amongst the Minatarees while on the
    Upper Missouri, a few years since, by taking from amongst my painting
    apparatus an old number of the <cite>New York Commercial Advertiser</cite>,
    edited by my kind and tried friend Colonel Stone. The Minatarees
    thought that I was mad, when they saw me for hours together, with my
    eyes fixed upon its pages. They had different and various conjectures
    about it; the most current of which was, that I was looking at it to
    cure my sore eyes, and they called it the “<em>medicine cloth for sore
    eyes</em>!” I at length put an end to this and several equally ignorant
    conjectures, by reading passages in it, which were interpreted to them,
    and the objects of the paper fully explained; after which, it was
    looked upon as much greater mystery than before; and several liberal
    offers were made me for it, which I was obliged to refuse, having
    already received a beautifully garnished robe for it, from the hands
    of a young son of Esculapius, who told me that if he could employ a
    good interpreter to explain everything in it, he could travel about
    amongst the Minatarees and Mandans, and Sioux, and exhibit it after I
    was gone; getting rich with presents, and adding greatly to the list of
    his <em>medicines</em>, as it would make him a great <em>Medicine-Man</em>.
    I left with the poor fellow his painted robe, and the newspaper; and
    just before I departed, I saw him unfolding it to show to some of his
    friends, when he took from around it, some eight or ten folds of birch
    bark and deer skins; all of which were carefully enclosed in a sack
    made of the skin of a pole cat, and undoubtedly destined to become, and
    to be called, his mystery or <em>medicine-bag</em>.</p>

  <p>The distance from Fort Gibson to the Missouri, where I struck the
    river, is about five hundred miles, and most of the way a beautiful
    prairie, in a wild and uncultivated state without roads and without
    bridges, over a great part of which I steered my course with my
    pocket-compass, fording and swimming the streams in the best manner I
    could; shooting prairie hens, and occasionally catching fish, which I
    cooked for my meals, and slept upon the ground at night. On my way I
    visited “Riqua’s Village” of Osages, and lodged during the night in
    the hospitable cabin of my old friend Beatte, of whom I have often
    spoken heretofore, as one of the guides and hunters for the dragoons
    on their campaign in the Camanchee country. This was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> most
    extraordinary hunter, I think, that I ever have met in all my travels.
    <em>To “hunt,”</em> was a phrase almost foreign to him, however, for
    when he went out with his rifle, it was “<em>for meat</em>,” or “<em>for
    cattle</em>;” and he never came in without it. He never told how many
    animals he had seen—how many he had wounded, &amp;c.—but his horse was
    always loaded with meat, which was thrown down in camp without comment
    or words spoken. Riqua was an early pioneer of Christianity in this
    country, who has devoted many years of his life, with his interesting
    family, in endeavouring to civilize and christianize these people, by
    the force of pious and industrious examples, which he has successfully
    set them; and, I think, in the most judicious way, by establishing
    a little village, at some miles distance from the villages of the
    Osages; where he has invited a considerable number of families who have
    taken their residence by the side of him; where they are following
    his virtuous examples in their dealings and modes of life, and in
    agricultural pursuits which he is teaching them, and showing them that
    they may raise the comforts and luxuries of life out of the ground,
    instead of seeking for them in the precarious manner in which they
    naturally look for them, in the uncertainty of the chase.</p>

  <p>It was a source of much regret to me, that I did not see this pious
    man, as he was on a Tour to the East, when I was in his little village.</p>

  <p>Beatte lived in this village with his aged parents, to whom he
    introduced me; and with whom, altogether, I spent a very pleasant
    evening in conversation. They are both French, and have spent the
    greater part of their lives with the Osages, and seem to be familiar
    with their whole history. This Beatte was the hunter and guide for a
    party of rangers (the summer before our campaign), with whom Washington
    Irving made his excursion to the borders of the Pawnee country; and of
    whose extraordinary character and powers, Mr. Irving has drawn a very
    just and glowing account, excepting one error which I think he has
    inadvertently fallen into, that of calling him a “<em>half breed</em>.”
    Beatte had complained of this to me often while out on the prairies;
    and when I entered his hospitable cabin, he said he was glad to see me,
    and almost instantly continued, “Now you shall see, Monsieur Catline, I
    am not ‘<em>half breed</em>,’ here I shall introduce you to my father and
    my mother, who you see are two very nice and good old French people.”</p>

  <p>From this cabin where I fared well and slept soundly, I started in the
    morning, after taking with them a good cup of coffee, and went smoothly
    on over the prairies on my course.</p>

  <p>About the middle of my journey, I struck a road leading into a small
    civilized settlement, called the “<em>Kickapoo prairie</em>,” to which I
    “bent my course;” and riding up to a log cabin which was kept as a sort
    of an hotel or tavern, I met at the door, the black boy belonging to my
    friend Captain Wharton, who I have said took his leave of Fort Gibson
    a few weeks before me; I asked the boy where his master was, to which
    he replied, “My good massa, Massa Wharton, in dese house, jist dead ob
    de libber compliment!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> I dismounted and went in, and to my deepest
    sorrow and anguish, I found him, as the boy said, nearly dead, without
    power to raise his head or his voice—his eyes were rolled upon me, and
    as he recognized me he took me by the hand, which he firmly gripped,
    whilst both shed tears in profusion. By placing my ear to his lips, his
    whispers could be heard, and he was able in an imperfect manner to make
    his views and his wishes known. His disease seemed to be a repeated
    attack of his former malady, and a severe affection of the liver, which
    was to be (as his physician said) the proximate cause of his death. I
    conversed with his physician who seemed to be a young and inexperienced
    man, who told me that he certainly could not live more than ten days. I
    staid two days with him, and having no means with me of rendering him
    pecuniary or other aid amongst strangers, I left him in kind hands, and
    started on my course again. My health improved daily, from the time of
    my setting out at Fort Gibson; and I was now moving along cheerfully,
    and in hopes soon to reach the end of my toilsome journey. I had yet
    vast prairies to pass over, and occasional latent difficulties, which
    were not apparent on their smooth and deceiving surfaces. Deep sunken
    streams, like ditches, occasionally presented themselves suddenly to my
    view, when I was within a few steps of plunging into them from their
    perpendicular sides, which were overhung with long wild grass, and
    almost obscured from the sight. The bearings of my compass told me that
    I must cross them, and the only alternative was to plunge into them,
    and get out as well as I could. They were often muddy, and I could
    not tell whether they were three or ten feet deep, until my horse was
    in them; and sometimes he went down head foremost, and I with him, to
    scramble out on the opposite shore in the best condition we could. In
    one of these canals, which I had followed for several miles in the
    vain hope of finding a shoal, or an accustomed ford, I plunged, with
    Charley, where it was about six or eight yards wide (and God knows how
    deep, for we did not go to the bottom), and swam him to the opposite
    bank, on to which I clung; and which, being perpendicular and of clay,
    and three or four feet higher than the water, was an insurmountable
    difficulty to Charley; and I led the poor fellow at least a mile, as
    I walked on the top of the bank, with the bridle in my hand, holding
    his head above the water as he was swimming; and I at times almost
    inextricably entangled in the long grass that was often higher than my
    head, and hanging over the brink, filled and woven together, with ivy
    and wild pea-vines. I at length (and just before I was ready to drop
    the rein of faithful Charley, in hopeless despair), came to an old
    buffalo ford, where the banks were graded down, and the poor exhausted
    animal, at last got out, and was ready and willing to take me and my
    luggage (after I had dried them in the sun) on the journey again.</p>

  <p>The Osage river which is a powerful stream, I struck at a place which
    seemed to stagger my courage very much. There had been heavy rains but
    a few days before, and this furious stream was rolling along its wild
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> turbid waters, with a freshet upon it, that spread its waters,
    in many places over its banks, as was the case at the place where I
    encountered it. There seemed to be but little choice in places with
    this stream, which, with its banks full, was sixty or eighty yards
    in width, with a current that was sweeping along at a rapid rate. I
    stripped everything from Charley, and tied him with his laso, until
    I travelled the shores up and down for some distance, and collected
    drift wood enough for a small raft, which I constructed, to carry my
    clothes and saddle, and other things, safe over. This being completed,
    and my clothes taken off, and they with other things, laid upon the
    raft, I took Charley to the bank and drove him in and across, where
    he soon reached the opposite shore, and went to feeding on the bank.
    Next was to come the “<em>great white medicine</em>;” and with him,
    saddle, bridle, saddle-bags, sketch-book, gun and pistols, coffee and
    coffee-pot, powder, and his clothes, all of which were placed upon
    the raft, and the raft pushed into the stream, and the “<em>medicine
    man</em>” swimming behind it, and pushing it along before him, until
    it reached the opposite shore, at least half a mile below! From this,
    his things were carried to the top of the bank, and in a little time,
    Charley was caught and dressed, and straddled, and on the way again.</p>

  <p>These are a few of the incidents of that journey of 500 miles, which I
    performed entirely alone, and which at last brought me out at Boonville
    on the Western bank of the Missouri. While I was crossing the river
    at that place, I met General Arbuckle, with two surgeons, who were to
    start the next day from Boonville for Fort Gibson, travelling over
    the route that I had just passed. I instantly informed them of the
    condition of poor Wharton, and the two surgeons were started off that
    afternoon at fullest speed, with orders to reach him in the shortest
    time possible, and do everything to save his life. I assisted in
    purchasing for him, several little things that he had named to me, such
    as jellies—acids—apples, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and saw them start; and (God knows),
    I shall impatiently hope to hear of their timely assistance, and of his
    recovery.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>From Boonville, which is a very pretty little town, building up with
    the finest style of brick houses, I crossed the river to New Franklin,
    where I laid by several days, on account of stormy weather; and from
    thence proceeded with success to the end of my journey, where I now am,
    under the roof of kind and hospitable friends, with my dear wife, who
    has patiently waited one year to receive me back, a wreck, as I now am;
    and who is to start in a few days with me to the coast of Florida, 1400
    miles South of this, to spend the winter in patching up my health, and
    fitting me for future campaigns.</p>

  <p>On this Tour (from which I shall return in the spring, if my health
    will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>admit of it), I shall visit the Seminoles in Florida,—the
    Euchees—the Creeks in Alabama and Georgia, and the Choctaws and
    Cherokees, who are yet remaining on their lands, on the East side of
    the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>We take steamer for New Orleans to morrow, so, till after another
    campaign, Adieu.</p>

  <p>About a year since I made a visit to the</p>

  <h3>KICKAPOOS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">At present but a small tribe, numbering six or 800, the remnant of a
    once numerous and warlike tribe. They are residing within the state of
    Illinois, near the south end of Lake Michigan, and living in a poor and
    miserable condition, although they have one of the finest countries in
    the world. They have been reduced in numbers by whiskey and small-pox,
    and the game being destroyed in their country, and having little
    industry to work, they are exceedingly poor and dependent. In fact,
    there is very little inducement for them to build houses and cultivate
    their farms, for they own so large and so fine a tract of country,
    which is now completely surrounded by civilized settlements, that they
    know, from experience, they will soon be obliged to sell out their
    country for a trifle, and move to the West.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> This system of moving has
    already commenced with them, and a considerable party have located on a
    tract of lands offered to them on the West bank of the Missouri river,
    a little north of Fort Leavenworth.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>The Kickapoos have long lived in alliance with the Sacs and Foxes, and
    speak a language so similar that they seem almost to be of one family.
    The present chief of this tribe, whose name is <em>Kee-an-ne-kuk</em>
    (the foremost man, <a href="#i_185"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 185</a>), usually called the <em>Shawnee
    Prophet</em>, is a very shrewd and talented man. When he sat for his
    portrait, he took his attitude as seen in the picture, which was that
    of prayer. And I soon learned that he was a very devoted Christian,
    regularly holding meetings in his tribe, on the sabbath, preaching
    to them and exhorting them to a belief in the Christian religion,
    and to an abandonment of the fatal habit of whiskey-drinking, which
    he strenuously represented as the bane that was to destroy them all,
    if they did not entirely cease to use it. I went on the sabbath,
    to hear this eloquent man preach, when he had his people assembled
    in the woods; and although I could not understand his language, I
    was surprised and pleased with the natural ease and emphasis, and
    gesticulation, which carried their own evidence of the eloquence of his
    sermon.</p>

  <p>I was singularly struck with the noble efforts of this champion of
    the mere remnant of a poisoned race, so strenuously labouring to
    rescue the remainder of his people from the deadly bane that has been
    brought amongst them by enlightened Christians. How far the efforts
    of this zealous man have succeeded in christianizing, I cannot tell,
    but it is quite certain that his exemplary and constant endeavours
    have completely abolished the practice of drinking whiskey in his
    tribe; which alone is a very praiseworthy achievement, and the first
    and indispensable step towards all other improvements. I was some time
    amongst these people, and was exceedingly pleased, and surprised also,
    to witness their sobriety, and their peaceable conduct; not having
    seen an instance of drunkenness, or seen or heard of any use made of
    spirituous liquors whilst I was amongst the tribe.</p>

  <p><em>Ah-ton-we-tuck</em> (the cock turkey, <a href="#i_185"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 186</a>), is another
    Kickapoo of some distinction, and a disciple of the Prophet; in the
    attitude of prayer also, which he is reading off from characters cut
    upon a stick that he holds in his hands. It was told to me in the tribe
    by the Traders (though I am afraid to vouch for the whole truth of
    it), that while a Methodist preacher was soliciting him for permission
    to preach in his village, the Prophet refused him the privilege, but
    secretly took him aside and supported him until he learned from him his
    creed, and his system of teaching it to others; when he discharged him,
    and commenced preaching amongst his people himself; pretending to have
    had an interview with some superhuman mission, or inspired personage;
    ingeniously resolving, that if there was any honour or emolument, or
    influence to be gained by the promulgation of it, he might as well
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>have it as another person; and with this view he commenced preaching
    and instituted a prayer, which he ingeniously carved on a maple-stick
    of an inch and a half in breadth, in characters somewhat resembling
    Chinese letters. These sticks, with the prayers on them, he has
    introduced into every family of the tribe, and into the hands of every
    individual; and as he has necessarily the manufacturing of them all, he
    sells them at his own price; and has thus added lucre to fame, and in
    two essential and effective ways, augmented his influence in his tribe.
    Every man, woman and child in the tribe, so far as I saw them, were in
    the habit of saying their prayer from this stick when going to bed at
    night, and also when rising in the morning; which was invariably done
    by placing the fore-finger of the right hand under the upper character,
    until they repeat a sentence or two, which it suggests to them; and
    then slipping it under the next, and the next, and so on, to the bottom
    of the stick, which altogether required about ten minutes, as it was
    sung over in a sort of a chaunt, to the end.</p>

  </figure >

  <p>Many people have called all this an ingenious piece of hypocrisy on
    the part of the Prophet, and whether it be so or not, I cannot decide;
    yet one thing I can vouch to be true, that whether his motives and
    his life be as pure as he pretends or not, his example has done much
    towards correcting the habits of his people, and has effectually turned
    their attention from the destructive habits of dissipation and vice, to
    temperance and industry, in the pursuits of agriculture and the arts.
    The world may still be unwilling to allow him much credit for this, but
    I am ready to award him a great deal, who can by his influence thus far
    arrest the miseries of dissipation and the horrid deformities of vice,
    in the descending prospects of a nation who have so long had, and still
    have, the white-skin teachers of vices and dissipation amongst them.</p>

  <p>Besides these two chiefs, I have also painted <em>Ma-shee-na</em>
    (the elk’s horn) <em>Ke-chim-qua</em> (the big bear), warriors, and
    <em>Ah-tee-wot-o-mee</em>, and <em>She-nah-wee</em>, women of the same
    tribe, whose portraits are in the Gallery.</p>

  <h3>WEE-AHS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">These are also the remnant of a once powerful tribe, and reduced by
    the same causes, to the number of 200. This tribe formerly lived in
    the State of Indiana, and have been moved with the Piankeshaws, to a
    position forty or fifty miles south of Fort Leavenworth.</p>

  <p><em>Go-to-kow-pah-a</em> (he who stands by himself, <a href="#i_187"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 187</a>),
    and <em>Wa-pon-je-a</em> (the swan), are two of the most distinguished
    warriors of the tribe, both with intelligent European heads.</p>

  <h3>POT-O-WAT-O-MIES.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The remains of a tribe who were once very numerous and warlike, but
    reduced by whiskey and small-pox, to their present number, which is not
    more than 2700. This tribe may be said to be semi-civilized, inasmuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
    as they have so long lived in contiguity with white people, with whom
    their blood is considerably mixed, and whose modes and whose manners
    they have in many respects copied. From a similarity of language as
    well as of customs and personal appearance, there is no doubt that
    they have formerly been a part of the great tribe of Chippeways or
    Ot-ta-was. Living neighbours and adjoining to them, on the North. This
    tribe live within the state of Michigan, and there own a rich and very
    valuable tract of land; which, like the Kickapoos, they are selling
    out to the Government, and about to remove to the west bank of the
    Missouri, where a part of the tribe have already gone and settled, in
    the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth. Of this tribe I have painted the
    portraits of <em>On-saw-kie</em> (the Sac, <a href="#i_189"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 189</a>), in the
    attitude of prayer, and <em>Na-pow-sa</em> (the Bear travelling in the
    night,) <a href="#i_189"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 190</a>, one of the principal chiefs of the tribe.
    These people have for some time lived neighbours to, and somewhat under
    the influence of the Kickapoos; and very many of the tribe have become
    zealous disciples of the Kickapoo prophet, using his prayers most
    devoutly, and in the manner that I have already described, as is seen
    in the first of the two last-named portraits.</p>

  <h3>KAS-KAS-KI-AS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">This is the name of a tribe that formerly occupied, and of course
    owned, a vast tract of country lying on the East of the Mississippi,
    and between its banks and the Ohio, and now forming a considerable
    portion of the great and populous state of Illinois. History furnishes
    us a full and extraordinary account of the once warlike character and
    numbers of this tribe; and also of the disastrous career that they have
    led, from their first acquaintance with civilized neighbours; whose
    rapacious avarice in grasping for their fine lands—with the banes of
    whiskey and small-pox, added to the unexampled cruelty of neighbouring
    hostile tribes, who have struck at them in the days of their adversity,
    and helped to erase them from existence.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there has been no other tribe on the Continent of equal power
    with the Kas-kas-ki-as, that have so suddenly sank down to complete
    annihilation and disappeared. The remnant of this tribe have long
    since merged into the tribe of Peorias of Illinois; and it is doubtful
    whether one dozen of them are now existing. With the very few remnants
    of this tribe will die in a few years a beautiful language, entirely
    distinct from all others about it, unless some enthusiastic person
    may preserve it from the lips of those few who are yet able to speak
    it. Of this tribe I painted <em>Kee-mon-saw</em> (the little chief),
    half-civilized, and, I should think, half-breed (<a href="#i_191"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 191</a>);
    and <em>Wah-pe-seh-see</em> (<a href="#i_191"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 192</a>), a very aged woman,
    mother of the same.</p>

  <p>This young man is chief of the tribe; and I was told by one of the
    Traders, that his mother and his son, were his only subjects! Whether
    this be true or not, I cannot positively say, though I can assert with
    safety <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>that there are but a very few of them left, and that those,
    like all of the last of tribes, will soon die of dissipation or broken
    hearts.</p>

  <h3>PE-O-RI-AS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The name of another tribe inhabiting a part of the state of
    Illinois; and, like the above tribes, but a remnant and civilized
    (or <em>cicatrized</em>, to speak more correctly). This tribe number
    about 200, and are, like most of the other remnants of tribes on the
    frontiers, under contract to move to the West of the Missouri. Of this
    tribe I painted the portrait of <em>Pah-me-cow-e-tah</em> (the man who
    tracks, <a href="#i_193"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 193</a>); and <em>Kee-mo-ra-ni-a</em> (no English,
    <a href="#i_193"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 194</a>). These are said to be the most influential men in
    the tribe, and both were very curiously and <em>well</em> dressed, in
    articles of civilized manufacture.</p>

  <h3>PI-AN-KE-SHAWS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The remnant of another tribe, of the states of Illinois and Indiana,
    who have also recently sold out their country to Government, and are
    under contract to move to the West of the Missouri, in the vicinity
    of Fort Leavenworth. <em>Ni-a-co-mo</em> (to fix with the foot,
    <a href="#i_195"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 195</a>), a brave of distinction; and <em>Men-son-se-ah</em>
    (the left hand, <a href="#i_195"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 196</a>), a fierce-looking and very
    distinguished warrior, with a stone-hatchet in his hand, are fair
    specimens of this reduced and enfeebled tribe, which do not number more
    than 170 persons at this time.</p>

  <h3>DELAWARES.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The very sound of this name has carried terror wherever it has been
    heard in the Indian wilderness; and it has travelled and been known, as
    well as the people, over a very great part of the Continent. This tribe
    originally occupied a great part of the Eastern border of Pennsylvania,
    and great part of the states of New Jersey and Delaware. No other
    tribe on the Continent has been so much moved and jostled about by
    civilized invasions; and none have retreated so far, or fought their
    way so desperately, as they have honourably and bravely contended for
    every foot of the ground they have passed over. From the banks of
    the Delaware to the lovely Susquehana, and <em>my native valley</em>,
    and to the base of and over, the Alleghany mountains, to the Ohio
    river—to the Illinois and the Mississippi, and at last to the West of
    the Missouri, they have been moved by Treaties after Treaties with the
    Government, who have now assigned to the mere handful of them that are
    left, a tract of land, as has been done a dozen times before, in <em>fee
    simple, for ever</em>! In every move the poor fellows have made, they
    have been thrust against their wills from the graves of their fathers
    and their children; and planted as they now are, on the borders of new
    enemies, where their first occupation has been to take up their weapons
    in self-defence, and fight for the ground they have been planted on.
    There is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> tribe, perhaps, amongst which greater and more continued
    exertions have been made for their conversion to Christianity; and that
    ever since the zealous efforts of the Moravian missionaries, who first
    began with them; nor any, amongst whom those pious and zealous efforts
    have been squandered more in vain; which has, probably, been owing to
    the bad faith with which they have so often and so continually been
    treated by white people, which has excited prejudices that have stood
    in the way of their mental improvement.</p>

  <p>This scattered and reduced tribe, which once contained some 10 or
    15,000, numbers at this time but 800; and the greater part of them have
    been for the fifty or sixty years past, residing in Ohio and Indiana.
    In these states, their reservations became surrounded by white people,
    whom they dislike for neighbours, and their lands too valuable for
    Indians—and the certain consequence has been, that they have sold out
    and taken lands West of the Mississippi; on to which they have moved,
    and on which it is, and always will be, almost impossible to find them,
    owing to their desperate disposition for roaming about, indulging in
    the chase, and in wars with their enemies.</p>

  <p>The wild frontier on which they are now placed, affords them so fine
    an opportunity to indulge both of these propensities, that they will
    be continually wandering in little and desperate parties over the vast
    buffalo plains, and exposed to their enemies, till at last the new
    country, which is given to them, in “fee simple, for ever,” and which
    is destitute of game, will be deserted, and they, like the most of
    the removed remnants of tribes, will be destroyed; and the faith of
    the Government well preserved, which has offered <em>this</em> as their
    <em>last move</em>, and these lands as <em>theirs in fee simple, for
    ever</em>.</p>

  <p>In my travels on the Upper Missouri, and in the Rocky Mountains,
    I learned to my utter astonishment, that little parties of these
    adventurous myrmidons, of only six or eight in numbers, had visited
    those remote tribes, at 2000 miles distance; and in several
    instances, after having cajoled a whole tribe—having been feasted in
    their villages—having solemnized the articles of everlasting peace
    with them, and received many presents at their hands, and taken
    affectionate leave, have brought away six or eight scalps with them;
    and nevertheless, braved their way, and defended themselves as they
    retreated in safety out of their enemies’ country, and through the
    regions of other hostile tribes, where they managed to receive the same
    honours, and come off with similar trophies.</p>

  <p>Amongst this tribe there are some renowned chiefs, whose lives, if
    correctly written, would be matter of the most extraordinary kind for
    the reading world; and of which, it may be in my power at some future
    time, to give a more detailed account. In <a href="#i_197"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 197</a> will be
    seen the portrait of one of the leading chiefs of the tribe, whose name
    is <em>Ni-co-man</em> (the answer), with his bow and arrows in his hand.
    <em>Non-on-da-gon</em> (<a href="#i_197"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 198</a>), with a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>silver ring in his
    nose, is another of the chiefs of distinction, whose history I admired
    very much, and whom, from his very gentlemanly attentions to me, I
    became much attached to. In both of these instances, their dresses were
    principally of stuffs of civilized manufacture; and their heads were
    bound with vari-coloured handkerchiefs or shawls, which were tastefully
    put on like a Turkish turban.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">MO-HEE-CON-NEUHS, or MOHEGANS (the good canoemen).</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">There are 400 of this once powerful and still famous tribe, residing
    near Green Bay, on a rich tract of land given to them by the
    Government, in the territory of Wisconsin, near Winnebago lake—on
    which they are living very comfortably; having brought with them from
    their former country, in the state of Massachusetts, a knowledge of
    agriculture, which they had there effectually learned and practiced.</p>

  <p>This tribe are the remains, and all that are left, of the once powerful
    and celebrated tribe of Pequots of Massachusetts. History tells us,
    that in their wars and dissensions with the whites, a considerable
    portion of the tribe moved off under the command of a rival chief,
    and established a separate tribe or band, and took the name of
    Mo-hee-con-neuhs, which they have preserved until the present day; the
    rest of the tribe having long since been extinct.</p>

  <p>The chief of this tribe, <em>Ee-tow-o-kaum</em> (both sides of the
    river, <a href="#i_199"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 199</a>), which I have painted at full length, with
    a psalm-book in one hand, and a cane in the other, is a very shrewd
    and intelligent man, and a professed, and I think, sincere Christian.
    <em>Waun-naw-con</em> (the dish), John W. Quinney (<a href="#i_199"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 200</a>),
    in civilized dress, is a civilized Indian, well-educated—speaking good
    English—is a Baptist missionary preacher, and a very plausible and
    eloquent speaker.</p>

  <h3>O-NEI-DA’S.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The remnant of a numerous tribe that have been destroyed by wars with
    the whites—by whiskey and small-pox, numbering at present but five or
    six hundred, and living in the most miserable poverty, on their reserve
    in the state of New York, near Utica and the banks of the Mohawk river.
    This tribe was one of the confederacy, called the Six Nations, and much
    distinguished in the early history of New York. The present chief is
    known by the name of <em>Bread</em> (<a href="#i_201"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 201</a>). He is a shrewd
    and talented man, well educated,—speaking good English—is handsome, and
    a polite and gentlemanly man in his deportment.</p>

  <h3>TUS-KA-RO-RA’S.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Another of the tribes in the confederacy of the Six Nations, once
    numerous, but reduced at present to the number of 500. This little
    tribe are living on their reserve, a fine tract of land, near Buffalo,
    in the state of New York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> and surrounded by civilized settlements.
    Many of them are good farmers, raising abundant and fine crops.</p>

  <p>The chief of the tribe is a very dignified man, by the name of
    <em>Cu-sick</em>, and his son, of the same name, whom I have painted
    (<a href="#i_201"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 202</a>), is a very talented man—has been educated for the
    pulpit in some one of our public institutions, and is now a Baptist
    preacher, and I am told a very eloquent speaker.</p>

  <h3>SEN-E-CA’S.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">One thousand two hundred in numbers at present, living on their
    reserve, near Buffalo, and within a few miles of Niagara Falls, in the
    state of New York. This tribe formerly lived on the banks of the Seneca
    and Cayuga lakes; but, like all the other tribes who have stood in the
    way of the “march of civilization,” have repeatedly bargained away
    their country, and removed to the West; which easily accounts for the
    origin of the familiar phrase that is used amongst them, that “they are
    going to the setting sun.”</p>

  <p>This tribe, when first known to the civilized world, contained some
    eight or ten thousand; and from their position in the centre of the
    state of New York, held an important place in its history. The Senecas
    were one of the most numerous and effective tribes, constituting the
    compact called the “Six Nations;” which was a confederacy formed by
    six tribes, who joined in a league as an effective mode of gaining
    strength, and preserving themselves by combined efforts which would be
    sufficiently strong to withstand the assaults of neighbouring tribes,
    or to resist the incursions of white people in their country. This
    confederacy consisted of the Senecas, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas,
    Mohawks, and Tuskaroras; and until the innovations of white people,
    with their destructive engines of war—with whiskey and small-pox, they
    held their sway in the country, carrying victory, and consequently
    terror and dismay, wherever they warred. Their war-parties were
    fearlessly sent into Connecticut and Massachusetts, to Virginia, and
    even to the Carolinas, and victory everywhere crowned their efforts.
    Their combined strength, however, in all its might, poor fellows, was
    not enough to withstand the siege of their insidious foes—a destroying
    flood that has risen and advanced, like a flood-tide upon them, and
    covered their country; has broken up their strong holds, has driven
    them from land to land; and in their retreat, has drowned the most of
    them in its waves.</p>

  <p>The Senecas are the most numerous remnant of this compact; and have
    at their head an aged and very distinguished chief, familiarly known
    throughout the United States, by the name of <em>Red Jacket</em>
    (<a href="#i_205"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 205</a>). I painted this portrait from the life, in the
    costume in which he is represented; and indulged him also, in the wish
    he expressed, “that he might be seen standing on the Table Rock, at the
    Falls of Niagara; about which place he thought his spirit would linger
    after he was dead.”</p>

  <p><em>Good Hunter</em> (<a href="#i_203"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 203</a>), and <em>Hard Hickory</em>
    (<a href="#i_203"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 204</a>), are fair <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>specimens of the warriors of this
    tribe or rather hunters; or perhaps, still more correctly speaking,
    <em>farmers</em>; for the Senecas have had no battles to fight lately,
    and very little game to kill, except squirrels and pheasants; and their
    hands are turned to the plough, having become, most of them, tolerable
    farmers; raising the necessaries, and many of the luxuries of life,
    from the soil.</p>

  <p>Of this interesting tribe, the visitors to my Gallery will find several
    other portraits and paintings of their customs; and in books that have
    been written, and are being compiled, a much more able and faithful
    account than I can give in an epistle of this kind.</p>

  <p>The fame as well as the face of Red Jacket, is generally familiar
    to the citizens of the United States and the Canadas; and for the
    information of those who have not known him, I will briefly say, that
    he has been for many years the head chief of the scattered remnants of
    that once powerful compact, the Six Nations; a part of whom reside on
    their reservations in the vicinity of the Senecas, amounting perhaps in
    all, to about four thousand, and owning some two hundred thousand acres
    of fine lands. Of this Confederacy, the Mohawks and Cayugas, chiefly
    emigrated to Canada, some fifty years ago, leaving the Senecas, the
    Tuskaroras, Oneidas, and Onondagas in the state of New York, on fine
    tracts of lands, completely surrounded with white population; who by
    industry and enterprize, are making the Indian lands too valuable to be
    long in their possession, who will no doubt be induced to sell out to
    the Government, or, in other words, to exchange them for lands West of
    the Mississippi, where it is the avowed intention of the Government to
    remove all the border tribes.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <p>Red Jacket has been reputed one of the greatest orators of his day;
    and, no doubt, more distinguished for his eloquence and his influence
    in council, than as a warrior, in which character I think history
    has not said much of him. This may be owing, in a great measure, to
    the fact that the wars of his nation were chiefly fought before his
    fighting days; and that the greater part of his life and his talents
    have been spent with his tribe, during its downfall; where, instead of
    the horrors of Indian wars, they have had a more fatal and destructive
    enemy to encounter, in the insidious encroachments of pale faces,
    which he has been for many years exerting his eloquence and all his
    talents to resist. Poor old chief—not all the eloquence of Cicero
    and Demosthenes would be able to avert the calamity, that awaits his
    declining nation—to resist the despoiling hand of mercenary white man,
    that opens and spreads liberally, but to entrap the unwary and ignorant
    within its withering grasp.</p>

  <p>This talented old man has for many years past, strenuously remonstrated
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>both to the Governor of New York, and the President of the United
    States, against the continual encroachments of white people; whom he
    represented as using every endeavour to wrest from them their lands—to
    destroy their game, introducing vices of a horrible character, and
    unknown to his people by nature! and most vehemently of all, has he
    continually remonstrated against the preaching of missionaries in his
    tribe; alleging, that the “black coats” (as he calls the clergymen),
    did more mischief than good in his tribe, by creating doubts and
    dissensions amongst his people! which are destructive of his peace,
    and dangerous to the success, and even <em>existence</em> of his tribe.
    Like many other great men who endeavour to soothe broken and painful
    feelings, by the kindness of the bottle, he has long since taken
    up whiskey-drinking to excess; and much of his time, lies drunk in
    his cabin, or under the corner of a fence, or wherever else its
    <em>kindness</em> urges the necessity of his dropping his helpless body
    and limbs, to indulge in the delightful <em>spell</em>. He is as great a
    drunkard as some of our most distinguished law-givers and law-makers;
    and yet <em>ten times more culpable</em>, as he has little to do in life,
    and wields the destinies of a nation in his hands!<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>There are no better people to be found, than the Seneca Indians—none
    that I know of that are by Nature more talented and ingenious; nor any
    that would be found to be better neighbours, if the arts and abuses of
    white men and whiskey, could be kept away from them. They have mostly
    laid down their hunting habits, and become efficient farmers, raising
    fine crops of corn, and a great abundance of hogs, cattle and horses,
    and other necessaries and luxuries of life.</p>

  <h3>I-RO-QUOIS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">One of the most numerous and powerful tribes that ever existed in the
    Northern regions of our country, and now one of the most completely
    annihilated. This tribe occupied a vast tract of country on the River
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, between its banks and Lake Champlain; and at times, by
    conquest, actually over-run the whole country, from that to the shores
    of Lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan. But by their continual wars with
    the French, English, and Indians, and dissipation and disease, they
    have been almost entirely annihilated. The few remnants of them have
    long since merged into other tribes, and been mostly lost sight of.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
    Of this tribe I have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>painted but one, <em>Not-o-way</em> (the thinker,
    <a href="#i_206"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 206</a>). This was an excellent man, and was handsomely
    dressed for his picture. I had much conversation with him, and became
    very much attached to him. He seemed to be quite ignorant of the early
    history of his tribe, as well as of the position and condition of its
    few scattered remnants, who are yet in existence. He told me, however,
    that he had always learned that the Iroquois had conquered nearly all
    the world; but the Great Spirit being offended at the great slaughters
    by his favourite people, resolved to punish them; and he sent a
    dreadful disease amongst them, that carried the most of them off, and
    all the rest that could be found, were killed by their enemies—that
    though he was an Iroquois, which he was proud to acknowledge to me,
    as I was to “make him live after he was dead;” he wished it to be
    generally thought, that he was a Chippeway, that he might live as long
    as the Great Spirit had wished it when he made him.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

      from their reservations in the state of New York.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> This celebrated chief died several years since, in his

      compiling, of the life of this extraordinary man, to an early perusal
      of which, I can confidently refer the world for much curious and
      valuable information.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> The whole of the Six Nations have been by some writers
      denominated Iroquois—how correct this may be, I am not quite able to
      say; one thing is certain, that is, that the Iroquois tribe did not all
      belong to that Confederacy, their original country was on the shores
      of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence; and, although one branch of their nation, the
      Mohawks, formed a part, and the most effective portion of that compact,
      yet the other members of it spoke different languages; and a great part
      of the Iroquois moved their settlements further North and East, instead
      of joining in the continual wars carried on by the Six Nations. It is
      of this part of the tribe that I am speaking, when I mention them as
      nearly extinct: and it is from this branch of the family that I got the
      portrait which I have introduced above.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> Since the above Letter was written, all the tribes
      and remnants of tribes mentioned in it have been removed by the

      them, in addition to considerable annuities, in consideration for the
      immense tracts of country they have left on the frontier, and within
      the States. The present positions of these tribes, and their relative
      locations to the civilized frontier and the wild, unjostled tribes,
      can be seen on a map in the beginning of this Volume. There are also
      other tribes there laid down, who have also been removed by Treaty
      stipulations, in the same way, which are treated of in subsequent
      Letters. The Government, under General Jackson, strenuously set forth
      and carried out, the policy of removing all the semi-civilized and
      border Indians, to a country West of the Mississippi; and although the
      project had many violent opponents, yet there were very many strong
      reasons in favour of it, and the thing <em>has been at last done</em>;
      and a few years will decide, by the best of all arguments, whether the
      policy was a good one or not. I may have occasion to say more on this
      subject hereafter; and in the mean time recommend the reader to examine
      their relative positions, and contemplate their prospects between their
      mortal foes on the West, and their acquisitive <em>friends</em> following
      them up from the East.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> I am thus taking a hasty glance at the tribes on the Atlantic
    Coast, on the borders of Mexico, and the confines of Canada, the
    reader will pardon me for taking him for a few minutes to the mouth
    of the Columbia, on the Pacific Coast; which place I have not yet
    quite reached myself, in my wild rambles, but most undoubtedly shall
    ere long, if my strolling career be not suddenly stopped. I scarcely
    need tell the reader where the Columbia River is, since its course and
    its character have been so often, and so well described, by recent
    travellers through those regions. I can now but glance at this remote
    country and its customs; and revert to it again after I shall have
    examined it in all its parts, and collected my materials for a fuller
    account.</p>

  <h3>FLAT HEADS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">These are a very numerous people, inhabiting the shores of the Columbia
    River, and a vast tract of country lying to the South of it, and living
    in a country which is exceedingly sterile and almost entirely, in many
    parts, destitute of game for the subsistence of the savage; they are
    mostly obliged to live on roots, which they dig from the ground, and
    fish which they take from the streams; the consequences of which are,
    that they are generally poor and miserably clad; and in no respect
    equal to the Indians of whom I have heretofore spoken, who live on the
    East of the Rocky Mountains, in the ranges of the buffaloes; where they
    are well-fed, and mostly have good horses to ride, and materials in
    abundance for manufacturing their beautiful and comfortable dresses.</p>

  <p>The people generally denominated Flat Heads, are divided into a great
    many bands, and although they have undoubtedly got their name from the
    custom of flattening the head; yet there are but very few of those so
    denominated, who actually practice that extraordinary custom.</p>

  <p>The <em>Nez Percés</em> who inhabit the upper waters and mountainous
    parts of the Columbia, are a part of this tribe, though they are
    seldom known to flatten the head like those lower down, and about the
    mouth of the river. <em>Hee-oh’ks-te-kin</em> (the rabbit skin leggings,
    <a href="#i_207"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 207</a>), and <em>H’co-a-h’co a-h’cotes-min</em> (no horns
    on his head, <a href="#i_207"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 208</a>), are young men of this tribe. These
    two young men, when I painted them, were in beautiful Sioux dresses,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>which had been presented to them in a talk with the Sioux, who
    treated them very kindly, while passing through the Sioux country.
    These two men were part of a delegation that came across the Rocky
    Mountains to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, a few years since, to enquire for the truth of
    a representation which they said some white man had made amongst them,
    “that our religion was better than theirs, and that they would all be
    lost if they did not embrace it.”</p>

  <p>Two old and venerable men of this party died in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and I
    travelled two thousand miles, companion with these two young fellows,
    towards their own country, and became much pleased with their manners
    and dispositions.</p>

  <p>The last mentioned of the two, died near the mouth of the Yellow
    Stone River on his way home, with disease which he had contracted
    in the civilized district; and the other one I have since learned,
    arrived safely amongst his friends, conveying to them the melancholy
    intelligence of the deaths of all the rest of his party; but assurances
    at the same time, from General Clark, and many Reverend gentlemen,
    that the report which they had heard was well founded; and that
    missionaries, good and religious men, would soon come amongst them to
    teach this religion, so that they could all understand and have the
    benefits of it.</p>

  <p>When I first heard the report of the object of this extraordinary
    mission across the mountains, I could scarcely believe it; but on
    conversing with General Clark on a future occasion, I was fully
    convinced of the fact; and I, like thousands of others, have had the
    satisfaction of witnessing the complete success that has crowned the
    bold and daring exertions of Mr. Lee and Mr. Spalding, two Reverend
    gentlemen who have answered in a Christian manner to this unprecedented
    call; and with their wives have crossed the most rugged wilds and
    wildernesses of the Rocky Mountains, and triumphantly proved to the
    world, that the Indians, in their native wilds are a kind and friendly
    people, and susceptible of mental improvement.</p>

  <p>I had long been of the opinion, that to ensure success, the exertions
    of pious men should be carried into the heart of the wilderness, beyond
    the reach and influence of civilized vices; and I so expressed my
    opinion to the Reverend Mr. Spalding and his lady, in Pittsburgh, when
    on their way, in their first Tour to that distant country. I have seen
    the Reverend Mr. Lee and several others of the mission, several years
    since the formation of their school; as well as several gentlemen who
    have visited their settlement, and from all, I am fully convinced of
    the complete success of these excellent and persevering gentlemen, in
    proving to the world the absurdity of the assertion that has been often
    made, “that the Indian can never be civilized or christianized.” Their
    uninterrupted transit over such a vast and wild journey, also, with
    their wives on horseback, who were everywhere on their way, as well as
    amongst the tribes where they have located, treated with the utmost
    kindness and respect, bears strong testimony to the assertions so often
    made by travellers in those countries, that these are, in their native
    state, a kind and excellent people.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

  <p>I hope I shall on a future occasion, be able to give the reader some
    further detailed account of the success of these zealous and excellent
    men, whose example, of penetrating to the <em>heart</em> of the Indian
    country, and <em>there</em> teaching the Indian in the true and effective
    way, will be a lasting honour to themselves, and I fully believe, a
    permanent benefit to those ignorant and benighted people.</p>

  <h3>THE CHINOOKS.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Inhabiting the lower parts of the Columbia, are a small tribe, and
    correctly come under the name of Flat Heads, as they are almost
    the only people who strictly adhere to the custom of squeezing and
    flattening the head. <a href="#i_209"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 209</a>, is the portrait of a Chinook
    boy, of fifteen or eighteen years of age, on whose head that frightful
    operation has never been performed. And in <a href="#i_209"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 210</a>, will
    be seen the portrait of a Chinook woman, with her child in her arms,
    her own head flattened, and the infant undergoing the process of
    flattening; which is done by placing its back on a board, or thick
    plank, to which it is lashed with thongs, to a position from which it
    cannot escape, and the back of the head supported by a sort of pillow,
    made of moss or rabbit skins, with an inclined piece (as is seen in the
    drawing), resting on the forehead of the child; being every day drawn
    down a little tighter by means of a cord, which holds it in its place,
    until it at length touches the nose; thus forming a straight line from
    the crown of the head to the end of the nose.</p>

  <p>This process is seemingly a very cruel one, though I doubt whether it
    causes much pain; as it is done in earliest infancy, whilst the bones
    are soft and cartilaginous, and easily pressed into this distorted
    shape, by forcing the occipital up, and the frontal down; so that the
    skull at the top, in profile, will show a breadth of not more than an
    inch and a half, or two inches; when in a front view it exhibits a
    great expansion on the sides, making it at the top, nearly the width of
    one and a half natural heads.</p>

  <p>By this remarkable operation, the brain is singularly changed from its
    natural shape; but in all probability, not in the least diminished
    or injured in its natural functions. This belief is drawn from the
    testimony of many credible witnesses, who have closely scrutinized
    them; and ascertained that those who have the head flattened, are in no
    way inferior in intellectual powers to those whose heads are in their
    natural shapes.</p>

  <p>In the process of flattening the head, there is often another form of
    crib or cradle, into which the child is placed, much in the form of a
    small canoe, dug out of a log of wood, with a cavity just large enough
    to admit the body of the child, and the head also, giving it room to
    expand in width; while from the head of the cradle there is a sort of
    lever, with an elastic spring to it that comes down on the forehead
    of the child, and produces the same effects as the one I have above
    described.</p>

  <p>The child is wrapped in rabbits’ skins, and placed in this little
    coffin-like <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>looking cradle, from which it is not, in some instances,
    taken out for several weeks. The bandages over and about the lower
    limbs, and as high up as the breast, are loose, and repeatedly taken
    off in the same day, as the child may require cleansing; but the head
    and shoulders are kept strictly in the same position, and the breast
    given to the child by holding it up in the cradle, loosing the outer
    end of the lever that comes over the nose, and raising it up of turning
    it aside, so as to allow the child to come at the breast, without
    moving its head.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_210a">
    <div class="plate"><i>126</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_210a.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>210½</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>The length of time that the infants are generally carried in these
    cradles is three, five, or eight weeks, until the bones are so formed
    as to keep their shapes, and preserve this singular appearance through
    life.</p>

  <p>This little cradle has a strap, which passes over the woman’s forehead
    whilst the cradle rides on her back; and if the child dies during its
    subjection to this rigid mode, its cradle becomes its coffin, forming
    a little canoe, in which it lies floating on the water in some sacred
    pool, where they are often in the habit of fastening the canoes,
    containing the dead bodies of the old and the young; or which is often
    the case, elevated into the branches of trees, where their bodies
    are left to decay, and their bones to dry; whilst they are bandaged
    in many skins, and curiously packed in their canoes, with paddles to
    propel, and ladles to bail them out, and provisions to last, and pipes
    to smoke, as they are performing their “long journey after death, to
    their contemplated hunting-grounds,” which these people think is to be
    performed in their canoes.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_209"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 210</a>½ letter <i>a</i>, is an accurate drawing of the
    above-mentioned cradle, perfectly exemplifying the custom described;
    and by the side of it (letter <i>b</i>,) the drawing of a Chinook
    skull, giving the front and profile view of it. Letter <i>c</i>, in the
    same plate, exhibits an Indian skull in its <em>natural</em> shape, to
    contrast with the <em>artificial</em>.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>This mode of flattening the head is certainly one of the most
    unaccountable, as well as unmeaning customs, found amongst the
    North American Indians. What it could have originated in, or for
    what purpose, other than a mere useless fashion, it could have been
    invented, no human being can probably ever tell. The Indians have many
    curious and ridiculous fashions, which have come into existence, no
    doubt, by accident, and are of no earthly use (like many silly fashions
    in enlightened society), yet they are perpetuated much longer, and
    that only because their ancestors practiced them in ages gone by. The
    greater part of Indian modes, however, and particularly those that are
    accompanied with much pain or trouble in their enactment, are most
    wonderfully adapted to the production of some good or useful results;
    for which the inquisitive world, I am sure, may for ever look in vain
    to this stupid and useless fashion, that has most unfortunately been
    engendered on these ignorant people, whose superstition forbids them to
    lay it down.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>It is a curious fact, and one that should be mentioned here, that
    these people have not been alone in this strange custom; but that it
    existed and was practiced precisely the same, until recently, amongst
    the Choctaws and Chickasaws; who occupied a large part of the states of
    Mississippi and Alabama, where they have laid their bones, and hundreds
    of their skulls have been procured, bearing incontrovertible evidence
    of a similar treatment, with similar results.</p>

  <p>The Choctaws who are now living, do not flatten the head; the custom,
    like that of the <em>medicine-bag</em>, and many others, which the
    Indians have departed from, from the assurances of white people, that
    they were of no use, and were utterly ridiculous to be followed. Whilst
    amongst the Choctaws, I could learn little more from the people about
    such a custom, than that “their old men recollected to have heard it
    spoken of”—which is much less satisfactory evidence than inquisitive
    white people get by referring to the grave, which the Indian never
    meddles with. The distance of the Choctaws from the country of the
    Chinooks, is certainly between two and three thousand miles; and
    there being no intervening tribes practicing the same custom—and no
    probability that any two tribes in a state of Nature, would ever hit
    upon so peculiar an absurdity, we come, whether willingly or not, to
    the conclusion, that these tribes must at some former period, have
    lived neighbours to each other, or have been parts of the same family;
    which time and circumstances have gradually removed to such a very
    great distance from each other. Nor does this, in my opinion (as many
    suppose), furnish any very strong evidence in support of the theory,
    that the different tribes have all sprung from one stock; but carries
    a strong argument to the other side, by furnishing proof of the very
    great tenacity these people have for their peculiar customs; many of
    which are certainly not general, but often carried from one end of the
    Continent to the other, or from ocean to ocean, by bands or sections
    of tribes, which often get “run off” by their enemies in wars, or
    in hunting, as I have before described; where to emigrate to a vast
    distance is not so unaccountable a thing, but almost the <em>inevitable
    result</em>, of a tribe that have got set in motion, all the way amongst
    deadly foes, in whose countries it would be fatal to stop.</p>

  <p>I am obliged therefore, to believe, that either the Chinooks emigrated
    from the Atlantic, or that the Choctaws came from the West side of the
    Rocky Mountains; and I regret exceedingly that I have not been able as
    yet, to compare the languages of these two tribes, in which I should
    expect to find some decided resemblance. They might, however, have been
    near neighbours, and practicing a copied custom where there was no
    resemblance in their language.</p>

  <p>Whilst among the Choctaws I wrote down from the lips of one of their
    chiefs, the following tradition, which seems strongly to favour the
    supposition that they came from a great distance in the West, and
    probably from beyond the Rocky Mountains:—<em>Tradition</em>. “The
    Choctaws, a great many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> winters ago, commenced moving from the country
    where they then lived, which was a great distance to the West of the
    great river, and the mountains of snow; and they were a great many
    years on their way. A great medicine-man led them the whole way, by
    going before with a red pole, which he stuck in the ground every night
    where they encamped. This pole was every morning found leaning to
    the East; and he told them that they must continue to travel to the
    East, until the pole would stand upright in their encampment, and that
    there the Great Spirit had directed that they should live. At a place
    which they named <em>Nah-ne-wa-ye</em> (the sloping hill); the pole
    stood straight up, where they pitched their encampment, which was one
    mile square, with the men encamped on the outside, and the women and
    children in the centre; which is the centre of the old Choctaw nation
    to ‘this day.’”</p>

  <p>In the vicinity of the mouth of the Columbia, there are, besides
    the <em>Chinooks</em>, the <em>Klick-a-tacks</em>, <em>Cheehaylas</em>,
    <em>Na-as</em>, and many other tribes, whose customs are interesting,
    and of whose manufactures, my Museum contains many very curious and
    interesting specimens, from which I have inserted a few outlines in
    <a href="#i_209"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 210</a>½, to which the reader will refer. Letter <i>d</i>,
    is a correct drawing of a Chinook canoe—<i>e</i>, a Na-as war-canoe,
    curiously carved and painted—<i>f</i>, two dishes or ladles for baling
    their canoes—<i>g</i>, a Stikeen mask, curiously carved and painted,
    worn by the mystery-men when in councils, for the purpose of calling
    up the Great or Evil Spirits to consult an the policy of peace or
    war—<i>h</i>, custom of the <em>Na-as</em> women of wearing a block of
    wood in the under lip, which is almost as unaccountable as the custom
    of flattening the head. Letter <i>i</i>, is a drawing of the block, and
    the exact dimensions of one in the Collection, taken out of the lip of
    a deceased <em>Na-as</em> woman—<i>k</i>, “wapito diggers,” instruments
    used by the women for digging the wapito, a bulbous root, much like a
    turnip, which the French Traders call <i lang="fr">pomme blanche</i>, and which
    I have before described. Letter <i>l</i>, <em>pau-to-mau-gons</em>, or
    <em>po-ko-mo-kons</em>, war-clubs, the one made by the Indians from a
    piece of native copper, the other of the bone of the sperm whale.
    Letter <i>n</i>, two very curiously carved pipes, made of black slate
    and highly polished.</p>

  <p>Besides these, the visitor will find in the Collection a great number
    of their very ingenious articles of dress; their culinary, war, and
    hunting implements, as well as specimens of their spinning and weaving,
    by which they convert dog’s hair and the wool of the mountain-sheep
    into durable and splendid robes, the production of which, I venture to
    say, would bid defiance to any of the looms in the American or British
    Factories.</p>

  <p>The Indians who inhabit the rugged wildernesses of the Rocky Mountains,
    are chiefly the Blackfeet and Crows, of whom I have heretofore spoken,
    and the Shoshonees or Snakes, who are a part of the Camanchees,
    speaking the same language, and the Shoshokies or root diggers, who
    inhabit the southern parts of those vast and wild realms, with the
    Arapahoes and Navahoes, who are neighbours to the Camanchees on the
    West, having Santa Fe on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> South, and the coast of California on
    the West. Of the Shoshonees and Shoshokies, all travellers who have
    spoken of them, give them a good character, as a kind and hospitable
    and harmless people; to which fact I could cite the unquestionable
    authorities of the excellent Rev. Mr. Parker, who has published his
    interesting Tour across the Rocky Mountains—Lewis and Clarke—Capt.
    Bonneville and others; and I allege it to be a truth, that the
    reason why we find them as they are uniformly described, a kind and
    inoffensive people, is, that they have not as yet been abused—that they
    are in their primitive state, as the Great Spirit made and endowed them
    with good hearts and kind feelings, unalloyed and untainted by the
    vices of the money-making world.</p>

  <p>To the same fact, relative to the tribes on the Columbia river, I have
    been allowed to quote the authority of H. Beaver, a very worthy and
    kind Reverend Gentleman of England, who has been for several years past
    living with these people, and writes to me thus:—</p>

  <p>“I shall be always ready, with pleasure, to testify my perfect
    accordance with the sentiments I have heard you express, both in
    your public lectures, and private conversation, relative to the
    much-traduced character of our Red brethren, particularly as it relates
    to their <em>honesty</em>, <em>hospitality</em> and <em>peaceableness</em>,
    throughout the length and breadth of the Columbia. Whatever of a
    contrary disposition has at any time, in those parts, been displayed
    by them, has, I am persuaded been exotic, and forced on them by the
    depravity and impositions of the white Traders.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of my last Letters from Fort Gibson, written some months since.
    I promised to open my note-book on a future occasion, to give some
    further account of tribes and remnants of tribes located in that
    vicinity, amongst whom I had been spending some time with my pen and
    my pencil; and having since that time extended my rambles over much of
    that ground again, and also through the regions of the East and South
    East, from whence the most of those tribes have emigrated; I consider
    this a proper time to say something more of them, and their customs and
    condition, before I go farther.</p>

  <p>The most of these, as I have said, are tribes or parts of tribes which
    the Government has recently, by means of Treaty stipulations, removed
    to that wild and distant country, on to lands which have been given to
    them in exchange for their valuable possessions within the States, ten
    or twelve hundred miles to the East.</p>

  <p>Of a number of such reduced and removed tribes, who have been located
    West of the Missouri, and North of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, I have already spoken in
    a former Letter, and shall yet make brief mention of another, which has
    been conducted to the same region—and then direct the attention of the
    reader to those which are settled in the neighbourhood of Fort Gibson,
    who are the Cherokees—Creeks—Choctaws—Chickasaws—Seminoles, and Euchees.</p>

  <p>The people above alluded to are the</p>

  <h3>SHA-WA-NO’S.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">The history of this once powerful tribe is so closely and necessarily
    connected with that of the United States, and the revolutionary war,
    that it is generally pretty well understood. This tribe formerly
    inhabited great parts of the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, (and
    for the last sixty years,) a part of the states of Ohio and Indiana,
    to which they had removed; and now, a considerable portion of them, a
    tract of country several hundred miles West of the Mississippi, which
    has been conveyed to them by Government in exchange for their lands in
    Ohio, from which it is expected the remainder of the tribe will soon
    move. It has been said that this tribe came formerly from Florida,
    but I do not believe it. The mere fact, that there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> found in East
    Florida a river by the name of <em>Su-wa-nee</em>, which bears some
    resemblance to <em>Sha-wa-no</em>, seems, as far as I can learn, to be
    the principal evidence that has been adduced for the fact. They have
    evidently been known, and that within the scope of our authenticated
    history, on the Atlantic coast—on the Delaware and Chesapeak bays.
    And after that, have fought their way against every sort of trespass
    and abuse—against the bayonet and disease, through the states of
    Pennsylvania, Delaware and Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, to
    their present location near the Konzas River, at least 1500 miles from
    their native country.</p>

  <p>This tribe and the Delawares, of whom I have spoken, were neighbours
    on the Atlantic coast, and alternately allies and enemies, have
    retrograded and retreated together—have fought their enemies united,
    and fought each other, until their remnants that have outlived their
    nation’s calamities, have now settled as neighbours together in the
    Western wilds; where, it is probable, the sweeping hand of death will
    soon relieve <em>them</em> from further necessity of warring or moving;
    and the <em>Government</em>, from the necessity or policy of proposing to
    them a yet more distant home. In their long and disastrous pilgrimage,
    both of these tribes laid claim to, and alternately occupied the
    beautiful and renowned valley of Wy-ô-ming; and after strewing the
    Susquehana’s lovely banks with their bones, and their tumuli, they both
    yielded at last to the dire necessity, which follows all civilized
    intercourse with natives, and fled to the Alleghany, and at last to
    the banks of the Ohio; where necessity soon came again, and again, and
    again, until the great <em>“Guardian” of all “red children”</em> placed
    them where they now are.</p>

  <p>There are of this tribe remaining about 1200; some few of whom are
    agriculturists, and industrious and temperate, and religious people;
    but the greater proportion of them are miserably poor and dependent,
    having scarcely the ambition to labour or to hunt, and a passion for
    whiskey-drinking, that sinks them into the most abject poverty, as they
    will give the last thing they possess for a drink of it.</p>

  <p>There is not a tribe on the Continent whose history is more interesting
    than that of the Shawanos, nor any one that has produced more
    extraordinary men.</p>

  <p>The great Tecumseh, whose name and history I can but barely allude
    to at this time, was the chief of this tribe, and perhaps the most
    extraordinary Indian of his age.</p>

  <p>The present chief of the tribe <em>Lay-law-she-kaw</em> (he who goes up
    the river, <a href="#i_211"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 211</a>), is a very aged, but extraordinary man,
    with a fine and intelligent head, and his ears slit and stretched down
    to his shoulders, a custom highly valued in this tribe; which is done
    by severing the rim of the ear with a knife, and stretching it down
    by wearing heavy weights attached to it at times, to elongate it as
    much as possible, making a large orifice, through which, on parades,
    &amp;c. they often pass a bunch of arrows of quills, and wear them as
    ornaments.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

  <p>In this instance (which was not an unusual one), the rims of the ears
    were so extended down, that they touched the shoulders, making a ring
    through which the whole hand could easily be passed. The daughter of
    this old chief, <em>Ka-te-qua</em> (the female eagle, <a href="#i_211"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    212</a>), was an agreeable-looking girl, of fifteen years of age, and much
    thought of by the tribe. <em>Pah-te-coo-saw</em> (the straight man,
    <a href="#i_213"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 213</a>), a warrior of this tribe, has distinguished himself
    by his exploits; and when he sat for his picture, had painted his face
    in a very curious manner with black and red paint.</p>

  <p><em>Ten-squa-ta-way</em> (the open door, <a href="#i_213"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 214</a>), called the
    “<em>Shawnee Prophet</em>,” is perhaps one of the most remarkable men,
    who has flourished on these frontiers for some time past. This man is
    brother of the famous Tecumseh, and quite equal in his <em>medicines</em>
    or mysteries, to what his brother was in arms; he was blind in his left
    eye, and in his right hand he was holding his “<em>medicine fire</em>,”
    and his “<em>sacred string of beans</em>” in the other. With these
    mysteries he made his way through most of the North Western tribes,
    enlisting warriors wherever he went, to assist Tecumseh in effecting
    his great scheme, of forming a confederacy of all the Indians on the
    frontier, to drive back the whites and defend the Indians’ rights;
    which he told them could never in any other way be protected. His plan
    was certainly a correct one, if not a very great one; and his brother,
    the Prophet, exercised his astonishing influence in raising men for him
    to fight his battles, and carry out his plans. For this purpose, he
    started upon an embassy to the various tribes on the Upper Missouri,
    nearly all of which he visited with astonishing success; exhibiting his
    mystery fire, and using his sacred string of beans, which every young
    man who was willing to go to war, was to touch, thereby taking the
    solemn oath to start when called upon, and not to turn back.</p>

  <p>In this most surprising manner, this ingenious man entered the villages
    of most of his inveterate enemies, and of others who never had heard
    of the name of his tribe; and manœuvred in so successful a way, as to
    make his medicines a safe passport for him to all of their villages;
    and also the means of enlisting in the different tribes, some eight or
    ten thousand warriors, who had solemnly sworn to return with him on his
    way back; and to assist in the wars that Tecumseh was to wage against
    the whites on the frontier. I found, on my visit to the Sioux—to the
    Puncahs, to the Riccarees and the Mandans, that he had been there,
    and even to the Blackfeet; and everywhere told them of the potency of
    his mysteries, and assured them, that if they allowed the fire to go
    out in their wigwams, it would prove fatal to them in every case. He
    carried with him into every wigwam that he visited, the image of a
    dead person of the size of life; which was made ingeniously of some
    light material, and always kept concealed under bandages of thin white
    muslin cloths and not to be opened; of this he made great mystery, and
    got his recruits to swear by touching a sacred string of white beans,
    which he had attached to its neck or some other way secreted about
    it. In this way by his extraordinary cunning, he had carried terror
    into the country as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> he went; and had actually enlisted some
    eight or ten thousand men, who were sworn to follow him home; and in
    a few days would have been on their way with him, had not a couple of
    his political enemies in his own tribe, followed on his track, even
    to those remote tribes, and defeated his plans, by pronouncing him an
    impostor; and all of his forms and plans an imposition upon them, which
    they would be fools to listen to. In this manner, this great recruiting
    officer was defeated in his plans, for raising an army of men to
    fight his brother’s battles; and to save his life, he discharged his
    medicines as suddenly as possible, and secretly travelled his way home,
    over those vast regions, to his own tribe, where the death of Tecumseh,
    and the opposition of enemies, killed all his splendid prospects, and
    doomed him to live the rest of his days in silence, and a sort of
    disgrace; like all men in Indian communities who pretend to <em>great
    medicine</em>, in any way, and fail; as they all think such failure an
    evidence of the displeasure of the Great Spirit, who always judges
    right.</p>

  <p>This, no doubt, has been a very shrewd and influential man, but
    circumstances have destroyed him, as they have many other great men
    before him; and he now lives respected, but silent and melancholy
    in his tribe. I conversed with him a great deal about his brother
    Tecumseh, of whom he spoke frankly, and seemingly with great pleasure;
    but of himself and his own great schemes, he would say nothing. He told
    me that Tecumseh’s plans were to embody all the Indian tribes in a
    grand confederacy, from the province of Mexico, to the Great Lakes, to
    unite their forces in an army that would be able to meet and drive back
    the white people, who were continually advancing on the Indian tribes,
    and forcing them from their lands towards the Rocky Mountains—that
    Tecumseh was a great general, and that nothing but his premature death
    defeated his grand plan.</p>

  <p>The Shawanos, like most of the other remnants of tribes, in whose
    countries the game has been destroyed, and by the use of whiskey, have
    been reduced to poverty and absolute want, have become, to a certain
    degree, agriculturists; raising corn and beans, potatoes, hogs, horses,
    &amp;c., so as to be enabled, if they could possess anywhere on earth, a
    country which they could have a certainty of holding in perpetuity, as
    their own, to plant and raise their own crops, and necessaries of life
    from the ground.</p>

  <p>The Government have effected with these people, as with most of the
    other dispersed tribes, an arrangement by which they are to remove West
    of the Mississippi, to lands assigned them; on which they are solemnly
    promised a home <em>for ever</em>; the uncertain definition of which
    important word, time and circumstances alone will determine.</p>

  <p>Besides the personages whom I have above-mentioned, I painted the
    portraits of several others of note in the tribe; and amongst them
    <em>Lay-loo-ah-pe-ai-shee-kaw</em> (the grass-bush and blossom), whom I
    introduce in this place, rather from the very handy and poetical name,
    than from any great personal distinction known to have been acquired by
    him.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">The CHER-O-KEES.</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Living in the vicinity of, and about Fort Gibson, on the Arkansas,
    and 700 miles west of the Mississippi river, are a third part or more
    of the once very numerous and powerful tribe who inhabited and still
    inhabit, a considerable part of the state of Georgia, and under a
    Treaty made with the United States Government, have been removed to
    those regions, where they are settled on a fine tract of country;
    and having advanced somewhat in the arts and agriculture before they
    started, are now found to be mostly living well, cultivating their
    fields of corn and other crops, which they raise with great success.</p>

  <p>Under a serious difficulty existing between these people (whom their
    former solemn Treaties with the United States Government, were
    acknowledged a free and independent nation, with powers to make and
    enforce their own laws), and the state of Georgia, which could not
    admit such a Government within her sovereignty, it was thought most
    expedient by the Government of the United States, to propose to them,
    for the fourth or fifth time, to enter into Treaty stipulations again
    to move; and by so doing to settle the difficult question with the
    state of Georgia, and at the same time, to place them in peaceable
    possession of a large tract of fine country, where they would for ever
    be free from the continual trespasses and abuses which it was supposed
    they would be subjected to, if they were to remain in the state of
    Georgia, under the present difficulties and the high excited feelings
    which were then existing in the minds of many people along their
    borders.</p>

  <p><em>John Ross</em>, a civilized and highly educated and accomplished
    gentleman, who is the head-chief of the tribe, (<a href="#i_215"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 215</a>),
    and several of his leading subordinate chiefs, have sternly and
    steadily rejected the proposition of such a Treaty; and are yet, with a
    great majority of the nation remaining on their own ground in the state
    of Georgia, although some six or 7000 of the tribe have several years
    since removed to the Arkansas, under the guidance and controul of an
    aged and dignified chief by the name of <em>Jol-lee</em> (<a href="#i_217"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    217</a>).</p>

  <p>This man, like most of the chiefs, as well as a very great proportion
    of the Cherokee population, has a mixture of white and red blood in
    his veins, of which, in this instance, the first seems decidedly to
    predominate. Another chief, and second to this, amongst this portion of
    the Cherokees, by the name of Teh-ke-neh-kee (the black coat), I have
    also painted and placed in my Collection, as well as a very interesting
    specimen of the Cherokee women (<a href="#i_215"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 216</a>).</p>

  <p>I have travelled pretty generally through the several different
    locations of this interesting tribe, both in the Western and Eastern
    divisions, and have found them, as well as the Choctaws and Creeks,
    their neighbours, very far advanced in the arts; affording to the world
    the most satisfactory evidences that are to be found in America, of the
    fact, that the Indian was not made to shun and evade good example, and
    necessarily to live and die a brute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> as many speculating men would
    needs record them and treat them, until they are robbed and trampled
    into the dust; that no living evidences might give the lie to their
    theories, or draw the cloak from their cruel and horrible iniquities.</p>

  <p>As I have repeatedly said to my readers, in the course of my former
    epistles, that the greater part of my time would be devoted to the
    condition and customs of the tribes that might be found in their
    primitive state, they will feel disposed to pardon me for barely
    introducing the Cherokees, and several others of these very interesting
    tribes, and leaving them and their customs and histories (which are of
    themselves enough for volumes), to the reader, who is, perhaps, nearly
    as familiar as I am myself, with the full and fair accounts of these
    people, who have had their historians and biographers.</p>

  <p>The history of the Cherokees and other numerous remnants of tribes,
    who are the exhabitants of the finest and most valued portions of the
    United States, is a subject of great interest and importance, and has
    already been woven into the most valued histories of the country, as
    well as forming material parts of the archives of the Government, which
    is my excuse for barely introducing the reader to them, and beckoning
    him off again to the native and untrodden wilds, to teach him something
    new and unrecorded. Yet I leave the subject, as I left the people (to
    whom I became attached, for their kindness and friendship), with a
    heavy heart, wishing them success and the blessing of the Great Spirit,
    who alone can avert the <em>doom</em> that would almost seem to be fixed
    for their unfortunate race.</p>

  <p>The Cherokees amount in all to about 22,000, 16,000 of whom are yet
    living in Georgia, under the Government of their chief, John Ross,
    whose name I have before mentioned; with this excellent man, who has
    been for many years devotedly opposed to the Treaty stipulations for
    moving from their country, I have been familiarly acquainted; and,
    notwithstanding the bitter invective and animadversions that have been
    by his political enemies heaped upon him, I feel authorized, and bound,
    to testify to the unassuming and gentlemanly urbanity of his manners,
    as well as to the rigid temperance of his habits, and the purity of
    his language, in which I never knew him to transgress for a moment, in
    public or private interviews.</p>

  <p>At this time, the most strenuous endeavours are making on the part
    of the Government and the state of Georgia, for the completion of an
    arrangement for the removal of the whole of this tribe, as well as
    of the Choctaws and Seminoles; and I have not a doubt of their final
    success, which seems, from all former experience, to attend every
    project of the kind made by the Government to their red children.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

  <p>It is not for me to decide, nor in this place to reason, as to the
    justice or injustice of the treatment of these people at the hands of
    the Government or individuals; or of the wisdom of the policy which is
    to place them in a new, though vast and fertile country, 1000 miles
    from the land of their birth, in the doubtful dilemma whether to break
    the natural turf with their rusting ploughshares, or string their bows,
    and dash over the boundless prairies, beckoned on by the alluring
    dictates of their nature, seeking laurels amongst the ranks of their
    new enemies, and subsistence amongst the herds of buffaloes.</p>

  <p>Besides the Cherokees in Georgia, and those that I have spoken
    of in the neighbourhood of Fort Gibson, there is another band or
    family of the same tribe, of several hundreds, living on the banks
    of the Canadian river, an hundred or more miles South West of Fort
    Gibson, under the Government of a distinguished chief by the name of
    <em>Tuch-ee</em> (familiarly called by the white people, “<em>Dutch</em>,”
    <a href="#i_217"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 218</a>). This is one of the most extraordinary men that
    lives on the frontiers at the present day, both for his remarkable
    history, and for his fine and manly figure, and character of face.</p>

  <p>This man was in the employment of the Government as a guide and hunter
    for the regiment of dragoons, on their expedition to the Camanchees,
    where I had him for a constant companion for several months, and
    opportunities in abundance, for studying his true character, and
    of witnessing his wonderful exploits in the different varieties of
    the chase. The history of this man’s life has been very curious and
    surprising; and I sincerely hope that some one, with more leisure and
    more talent than myself, will take it up, and do it justice. I promise
    that the life of this man furnishes the best materials for a popular
    tale, that are now to be procured on the Western frontier.</p>

  <p>He is familiarly known, and much of his life, to all the officers who
    have been stationed at Fort Gibson, or at any of the posts in that
    region of country.</p>

  <p>Some twenty years or more since, becoming fatigued and incensed with
    civilized encroachments, that were continually making on the borders of
    the Cherokee country in Georgia, where he then resided, and probably,
    foreseeing the disastrous results they were to lead to, he beat up
    for volunteers to emigrate to the West, where he had designed to go,
    and colonize in a wild country beyond the reach and contamination of
    civilized innovations; and succeeded in getting several hundred men,
    women, and children, whom he led over the banks of the Mississippi, and
    settled upon the head waters of White River, where they lived until
    the appearance of white faces, which began to peep through the forests
    at them, when they made another move of 600 miles to the banks of the
    Canadian, where they now reside; and where, by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>the system of desperate
    warfare, which he has carried on against the Osages and the Camanchees,
    he has successfully cleared away from a large tract of fine country,
    all the enemies that could contend for it, and now holds it, with his
    little band of myrmidons, as their own undisputed soil, where they are
    living comfortably by raising from the soil fine crops of corn and
    potatoes, and other necessaries of life; whilst they indulge whenever
    they please, in the pleasures of the chase amongst the herds of
    buffaloes, or in the natural propensity for ornamenting their dresses
    and their war-clubs with the scalp-locks of their enemies.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">The CREEKS (or MUS-KO-GEES).</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Of 20,000 in numbers, have, until quite recently, occupied an immense
    tract of country in the states of Mississippi and Alabama; but by a
    similar arrangement (and for a similar purpose) with the Government,
    have exchanged their possessions there for a country, adjoining to
    the Cherokees, on the South side of the Arkansas, to which they have
    already all removed, and on which, like the Cherokees, they are laying
    out fine farms, and building good houses, in which they live; in many
    instances, surrounded by immense fields of corn and wheat. There is
    scarcely a finer country on earth than that now owned by the Creeks;
    and in North America, certainly no Indian tribe more advanced in the
    arts and agriculture than they are. It is no uncommon thing to see a
    Creek with twenty or thirty slaves at work on his plantation, having
    brought them from a slave-holding country, from which, in their long
    journey, and exposure to white man’s ingenuity, I venture to say, that
    most of them got rid of one-half of them, whilst on their long and
    disastrous crusade.</p>

  <p>The Creeks, as well as the Cherokees and Choctaws, have good schools
    and churches established amongst them, conducted by excellent and pious
    men, from whose example they are drawing great and lasting benefits.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">plates</span> 219 and 220, I have given the portraits of two
    distinguished men, and I believe, both chiefs. The first by the name
    of <em>Stee-cha-co-me-co</em> (the great king), familiarly called
    “Ben Perryman;” and the other. <em>Hol-te-mal-te-tez-te-neehk-ee</em>
    (——), called “Sam Perryman.” These two men are brothers, and are
    fair specimens of the tribe, who are mostly clad in calicoes, and
    other cloths of civilized manufacture; tasselled and fringed oft by
    themselves in the most fantastic way, and sometimes with much true and
    picturesque taste. They use a vast many beads, and other trinkets, to
    hang upon their necks, and ornament their moccasins and beautiful belts.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">The CHOCTAWS.</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Of fifteen thousand, are another tribe, removed from the Northern
    parts of Alabama, and Mississippi, within the few years past, and now
    occupying a large and rich tract of country, South of the Arkansas and
    the Canadian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>rivers; adjoining to the country of the Creeks and the
    Cherokees, equally civilized, and living much in the same manner.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_223">
    <div class="plate"><i>124</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_223.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>223</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>In this tribe I painted the portrait of their famous and excellent
    chief, <em>Mo-sho-la-tub-bee</em> (he who puts out and kills,
    <a href="#i_221"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 221</a>), who has since died of the small-pox. In the same
    plate will also be seen, the portrait of a distinguished and very
    gentlemanly man, who has been well-educated, and who gave me much
    curious and valuable information, of the history and traditions of his
    tribe. The name of this man, is <em>Ha-tchoc-tuck-nee</em> (the snapping
    turtle, <a href="#i_221"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 222</a>), familiarly called by the whites “<em>Peter
    Pinchlin</em>.”</p>

  <p>These people seem, even in their troubles, to be happy; and have,
    like all the other remnants of tribes, preserved with great tenacity
    their different games, which it would seem they are everlastingly
    practicing for want of other occupations or amusements in life. Whilst
    I was staying at the Choctaw agency in the midst of their nation, it
    seemed to be a sort of season of amusements, a kind of holiday; when
    the whole tribe almost, were assembled around the establishment, and
    from day to day we were entertained with some games or feats that were
    exceedingly amusing: horse-racing, dancing, wrestling, foot-racing, and
    ball-playing, were amongst the most exciting; and of all the catalogue,
    the most beautiful, was decidedly that of ball-playing. This wonderful
    game, which is the favourite one amongst all the tribes, and with these
    Southern tribes played exactly the same, can never be appreciated by
    those who are not happy enough to see it.</p>

  <p>It is no uncommon occurrence for six or eight hundred or a thousand of
    these young men, to engage in a game of ball, with five or six times
    that number of spectators, of men, women and children, surrounding the
    ground, and looking on. And I pronounce such a scene, with its hundreds
    of Nature’s most beautiful models, denuded, and painted of various
    colours, running and leaping into the air, in all the most extravagant
    and varied forms, in the desperate struggles for the ball, a school for
    the painter or sculptor, equal to any of those which ever inspired the
    hand of the artist in the Olympian games or the Roman forum.</p>

  <p>I have made it an uniform rule, whilst in the Indian country, to
    attend every ball-play I could hear of, if I could do it by riding a
    distance of twenty or thirty miles; and my usual custom has been on
    such occasions, to straddle the back of my horse, and look on to the
    best advantage. In this way I have sat, and oftentimes reclined, and
    almost dropped from my horse’s back, with irresistible laughter at the
    succession of droll tricks, and kicks and scuffles which ensue, in
    the almost superhuman struggles for the ball. These plays generally
    commence at nine o’clock, or near it, in the morning; and I have more
    than once balanced myself on my pony, from that time till near sundown,
    without more than one minute of intermission at a time, before the game
    has been decided.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for pen and ink alone, or brushes, or even with
    their combined efforts, to give more than a <em>caricature</em> of such
    a scene; but such as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> have been able to do, I have put upon the
    canvass, and in the slight outlines which I have here attached in
    <span class="smcap">plates</span> 224, <a href="#i_225">225</a>, <a href="#i_226">226</a>, taken from those paintings, (for the
    colouring to which the reader must look to my pen,) I will convey as
    correct an account as I can, and leave the reader to imagine the rest;
    or look to <em>other books</em> for what I may have omitted.</p>

  <p>While at the Choctaw agency it was announced, that there was to be a
    great play on a certain day, within a few miles, on which occasion I
    attended, and made the three sketches which are hereto annexed; and
    also the following entry in my note-book, which I literally copy out.</p>

  <p>“Monday afternoon at three, o’clock, I rode out with Lieutenants S.
    and M., to a very pretty prairie, about six miles distant, to the
    ball-play-ground of the Choctaws, where we found several thousand
    Indians encamped. There were two points of timber about half a mile
    apart, in which the two parties for the play, with their respective
    families and friends, were encamped; and lying between them, the
    prairie on which the game was to be played. My companions and myself,
    although we had been apprised, that to see the whole of a ball-play,
    we must remain on the ground all the night previous, had brought
    nothing to sleep upon, resolving to keep our eyes open, and see what
    transpired through the night. During the afternoon, we loitered about
    amongst the different tents and shantees of the two encampments, and
    afterwards, at sundown, witnessed the ceremony of measuring out the
    ground, and erecting the “byes” or goals which were to guide the play.
    Each party had their goal made with two upright posts, about 25 feet
    high and six feet apart, set firm in the ground, with a pole across
    at the top. These goals were about forty or fifty rods apart; and at
    a point just half way between, was another small stake, driven down,
    where the ball was to be thrown up at the firing of a gun, to be
    struggled for by the players. All this preparation was made by some
    old men, who were, it seems, selected to be the judges of the play,
    who drew a line from one bye to the other; to which directly came from
    the woods, on both sides, a great concourse of women and old men,
    boys and girls, and dogs and horses, where bets were to be made on
    the play. The betting was all done across this line, and seemed to be
    chiefly left to the women, who seemed to have martialled out a little
    of everything that their houses and their fields possessed. Goods and
    chattels—knives—dresses—blankets—pots and kettles—dogs and horses, and
    guns; and all were placed in the possession of <em>stake-holders</em>,
    who sat by them, and watched them on the ground all night, preparatory
    to the play.</p>

  <p>The sticks with which this tribe play, are bent into an oblong hoop
    at the end, with a sort of slight web of small thongs tied across, to
    prevent the ball from passing through. The players hold one of these in
    each hand, and by leaping into the air, they catch the ball between the
    two nettings and throw it, without being allowed to strike it, or catch
    it in their hands.</p>

  <p>The mode in which these sticks are constructed and used, will be seen
    in the portrait of <em>Tullock-chish-ko</em> (he who drinks the juice of
    the stone), the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> most distinguished ball-player of the Choctaw nation
    (<a href="#i_223"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 223</a>), represented in his ball-play dress, with his
    ball-sticks in his hands. In every ball-play of these people, it is a
    rule of the play, that no man shall wear moccasins on his feet, or any
    other dress than his breech-cloth around his waist, with a beautiful
    bead belt, and a “tail,” made of white horsehair or quills, and a
    “<em>mane</em>” on the neck, of horsehair dyed of various colours.</p>

  <p>This game had been arranged and “made up,” three or four months before
    the parties met to play it, and in the following manner:—The two
    champions who led the two parties, and had the alternate choosing of
    the players through the whole tribe, sent runners, with the ball-sticks
    most fantastically ornamented with ribbons and red paint, to be touched
    by each one of the chosen players; who thereby agreed to be on the
    spot at the appointed time and ready for the play. The ground having
    been all prepared and preliminaries of the game all settled, and the
    bettings all made, and goods all “staked,” night came on without
    the appearance of any players on the ground. But soon after dark, a
    procession of lighted flambeaux was seen coming from each encampment,
    to the ground where the players assembled around their respective byes;
    and at the beat of the drums and chaunts of the women, each party of
    players commenced the “ball-play dance” (<a href="#i_224"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 224</a>). Each
    party danced for a quarter of an hour around their respective byes,
    in their ball-play dress; rattling their ball-sticks together in the
    most violent manner, and all singing as loud as they could raise their
    voices; whilst the women of each party, who had their goods at stake,
    formed into two rows on the line between the two parties of players,
    and danced also, in an uniform step, and all their voices joined in
    chaunts to the Great Spirit; in which they were soliciting his favour
    in deciding the game to their advantage; and also encouraging the
    players to exert every power they possessed, in the struggle that was
    to ensue. In the mean time, four old <em>medicine-men</em>, who were to
    have the starting of the ball, and who were to be judges of the play,
    were seated at the point where the ball was to be started; and busily
    smoking to the Great Spirit for their success in judging rightly, and
    impartially, between the parties in so important an affair.</p>

  <p>This dance was one of the most picturesque scenes imaginable, and was
    repeated at intervals of every half hour during the night, and exactly
    in the same manner; so that the players were certainly awake all the
    night, and arranged in their appropriate dress, prepared for the play
    which was to commence at nine o’clock the next morning. In the morning,
    at the hour, the two parties and all their friends, were drawn out
    and over the ground; when at length the game commenced, by the judges
    throwing up the ball at the firing of a gun; when an instant struggle
    ensued between the players, who were some six or seven hundred in
    numbers, and were mutually endeavouring to catch the ball in their
    sticks, and throw it home and between their respective stakes; which,
    whenever successfully done, counts one for game. In this game every
    player was dressed alike, that is, <em>divested</em> of all dress, except
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> girdle and the tail, which I have before described; and in these
    desperate struggles for the ball, when it is <em>up</em> (<a href="#i_225"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    225</a>, where hundreds are running together and leaping, actually over
    each other’s heads, and darting between their adversaries’ legs,
    tripping and throwing, and foiling each other in every possible manner,
    and every voice raised to the highest key, in shrill yelps and barks)!
    there are rapid successions of feats, and of incidents, that astonish
    and amuse far beyond the conception of any one who has not had the
    singular good luck to witness them. In these struggles, every mode is
    used that can be devised, to oppose the progress of the foremost, who
    is likely to get the ball; and these obstructions often meet desperate
    individual resistance, which terminates in a violent scuffle, and
    sometimes in fisticuffs; when their sticks are dropped, and the parties
    are unmolested, whilst they are settling it between themselves; unless
    it be by a general <em>stampede</em>, to which they are subject who are
    down, if the ball happens to pass in their direction. Every weapon, by
    a rule of all ball-plays, is laid by in their respective encampments,
    and no man allowed to go for one; so that the sudden broils that take
    place on the ground, are presumed to be as suddenly settled without any
    probability of much personal injury; and no one is allowed to interfere
    in any way with the contentious individuals.</p>

  <p>There are times, when the ball gets to the ground (<a href="#i_226"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 226</a>),
    and such a confused mass rushing together around it, and knocking
    their sticks together, without the possibility of any one getting or
    seeing it, for the dust that they raise, that the spectator loses his
    strength, and everything else but his senses; when the condensed mass
    of ball-sticks, and shins, and bloody noses, is carried around the
    different parts of the ground, for a quarter of an hour at a time,
    without any one of the mass being able to see the ball; and which they
    are often thus scuffling for, several minutes after it has been thrown
    off, and played over another part of the ground.</p>

  <p>For each time that the ball was passed between the stakes of either
    party, one was counted for their game, and a halt of about one minute;
    when it was again started by the judges of the play, and a similar
    struggle ensued; and so on until the successful party arrived to 100,
    which was the limit of the game, and accomplished at an hour’s sun,
    when they took the stakes; and then, by a previous agreement, produced
    a number of jugs of whiskey, which gave all a wholesome drink, and sent
    them all off merry and in good humour, but not drunk.</p>

  <p>After this exciting day, the concourse was assembled in the vicinity
    of the agency house, where we had a great variety of dances and other
    amusements; the most of which I have described on former occasions.
    One, however, was new to me, and I must say a few words of it: this
    was the <em>Eagle Dance</em>, a very pretty scene, which is got up by
    their young men, in honour of that bird, for which they seem to have a
    religious regard. This picturesque dance was given by twelve or sixteen
    men, whose bodies were chiefly naked and painted white, with white
    clay, and each <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>one holding in his hand the tail of the eagle,
    while his head was also decorated with an eagle’s quill (<a href="#i_227"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    227</a>). Spears were stuck in the ground, around which the dance was
    performed by four men at a time, who had simultaneously, at the beat of
    the drum, jumped up from the ground where they had all sat in rows of
    four, one row immediately behind the other, and ready to take the place
    of the first four when they left the ground fatigued, which they did
    by hopping or jumping around behind the rest, and taking their seats,
    ready to come up again in their turn, after each of the other sets had
    been through the same forms.</p>

  <p>In this dance, the steps or rather jumps, were different from anything
    I had ever witnessed before, as the dancers were squat down, with their
    bodies almost to the ground, in a severe and most difficult posture, as
    will have been seen in the drawing.</p>

  <p>I have already, in a former Letter, while speaking of the ancient
    custom of flattening the head, given a curious tradition of this
    interesting tribe, accounting for their having come from the West, and
    I here insert another or two, which I had, as well as the former one,
    from the lips of Peter Pinchlin, a very intelligent and influential man
    in the tribe, of whom I have spoken in <a href="#Page_123">page 123</a>.</p>

  <p><em>The Deluge.</em> “Our people have always had a tradition of the
    Deluge, which happened in this way:—there was total darkness for
    a great time over the whole of the earth; the Choctaw doctors or
    mystery-men looked out for daylight for a long time, until at last they
    despaired of ever seeing it, and the whole nation were very unhappy. At
    last a light was discovered in the North and there was great rejoicing,
    until it was found to be great mountains of water rolling on, which
    destroyed them all, except a few families who had expected it and built
    a great raft, on which they were saved.”</p>

  <p><em>Future State.</em> “Our people all believe that the spirit lives in a
    future state—that it has a great distance to travel after death towards
    the West—that it has to cross a dreadful deep and rapid stream, which
    is hemmed in on both sides by high and rugged hills—over this stream,
    from hill to hill, there lies a long and slippery pine-log, with the
    bark peeled off, over which the dead have to pass to the delightful
    hunting-grounds. On the other side of the stream there are six persons
    of the good hunting-grounds, with rocks in their hands, which they
    throw at them all when they are on the middle of the log. The good walk
    on safely, to the good hunting-grounds, where there is one continual
    day—where the trees are always green—where the sky has no clouds—where
    there are continual fine and cooling breezes—where there is one
    continual scene of feasting, dancing and rejoicing—where there is no
    pain or trouble, and people never grow old, but for ever live young and
    enjoy the youthful pleasures.</p>

  <p>“The wicked see the stones coming, and try to dodge, by which they fall
    from the log, and go down thousands of feet to the water, which is
    dashing over the rocks, and is stinking with dead fish, and animals,
    where they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> carried around and brought continually back to the same
    place in whirlpools—where the trees are all dead, and the waters are
    full of toads and lizards, and snakes—where the dead are always hungry,
    and have nothing to eat—are always sick, and never die—where the sun
    never shines, and where the wicked are continually climbing up by
    thousands on the sides of a high rock from which they can overlook the
    beautiful country of the good hunting-grounds, the place of the happy,
    but never can reach it.”</p>

  <p>Origin of the <em>Craw-fish band</em>. “Our people have amongst them a
    band which is called, the <em>Craw-fish band</em>. They formerly, but at
    a very remote period, lived under ground, and used to come up out of
    the mud—they were a species of craw-fish; and they went on their hands
    and feet, and lived in a large cave deep under ground, where there was
    no light for several miles. They spoke no language at all, nor could
    they understand any. The entrance to their cave was through the mud—and
    they used to run down through that, and into their cave; and thus, the
    Choctaws were for a long time unable to molest them. The Choctaws used
    to lay and wait for them to come out into the sun, where they would try
    to talk to them, and cultivate an acquaintance.</p>

  <p>“One day, a parcel of them were run upon so suddenly by the Choctaws,
    that they had no time to go through the mud into their cave, but
    were driven into it by another entrance, which they had through the
    rocks. The Choctaws then tried a long time to smoke them out, and
    at last succeeded—they treated them kindly—taught them the Choctaw
    language—taught them to walk on two legs—made them cut off their toe
    nails, and pluck the hair from their bodies, after which they adopted
    them into their nation—and the remainder of them are living under
    ground to this day.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT SNELLING, <i>FALL OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> ANTHONY</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Having</span> recruited my health during the last winter, in recreation and
    amusements on the Coast of Florida, like a <em>bird of passage</em> I
    started, at the rallying notes of the swan and the wild goose, for the
    cool and freshness of the North, but the gifted passengers soon left me
    behind. I found them here, their nests built—their eggs hatched—their
    offspring fledged and figuring in the world, before I arrived.</p>

  <p>The majestic river from the Balize to the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, I have
    just passed over; with a high-wrought mind filled with amazement
    and wonder, like other travellers who occasionally leave the stale
    and profitless routine of the “Fashionable Tour,” to gaze with
    admiration upon the wild and native grandeur and majesty of this
    great Western world. The Upper Mississippi, like the Upper Missouri,
    must be approached to be appreciated; for all that can be seen on the
    Mississippi below <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, or for several hundred miles above it,
    gives no hint or clue to the magnificence of the scenes which are
    continually opening to the view of the traveller, and riveting him to
    the deck of the steamer, through sunshine, lightning or rain, from the
    mouth of the Ouisconsin to the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony.</p>

  <p>The traveller in ascending the river, will see but little of
    picturesque beauty in the landscape, until he reaches Rock Island; and
    from that point he will find it growing gradually more interesting,
    until he reaches Prairie du Chien; and from that place until he arrives
    at Lake Pepin, every reach and turn in the river presents to his eye
    a more immense and magnificent scene of grandeur and beauty. From day
    to day, the eye is riveted in listless, tireless admiration, upon the
    thousand bluffs which tower in majesty above the river on either side,
    and alternate as the river bends, into countless fascinating forms.</p>

  <p>The whole face of the country is covered with a luxuriant growth of
    grass, whether there is timber or not; and the magnificent bluffs,
    studding the sides of the river, and rising in the forms of immense
    cones, domes and ramparts, give peculiar pleasure, from the deep and
    soft green in which they are clad up their broad sides, and to their
    extreme tops, with a carpet of grass, with spots and clusters of timber
    of a deeper green; and apparently in many places, arranged in orchards
    and pleasure-grounds by the hands of art.</p>

  <p>The scenes that are passed between Prairie du Chien and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters,
    including Lake Pepin, between whose magnificently turretted shores one
    passes for twenty-two miles, will amply reward the tourist for the
    time and expense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> of a visit to them. And to him or her of too little
    relish for Nature’s rude works, to profit as they pass, there will be
    found a redeeming pleasure at the mouth of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters and the Fall
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony. This scene has often been described, and I leave it
    for the world to come and gaze upon for themselves; recommending to
    them at the same time, to denominate the next “Fashionable Tour,” a
    trip to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis; thence by steamer to Rock Island, Galena, Dubuque,
    Prairie du Chien, Lake Pepin, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, back to
    Prairie du Chien, from thence to Fort Winnebago, Green Bay, Mackinaw,
    Sault de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, Detroit, Buffalo, Niagara, and home. This Tour
    would comprehend but a small part of the great “Far West;” but it will
    furnish to the traveller a fair sample, and being a part of it which
    is now made so easily accessible to the world, and the only part of it
    to which <em>ladies</em> can have access, I would recommend to all who
    have time and inclination to devote to the enjoyment of so splendid a
    Tour, to wait not, but make it while the subject is new, and capable
    of producing the greatest degree of pleasure. To the world at large,
    this trip is one of surpassing interest—to the artist it has a double
    relish, and to <em>me</em>, still further inducements; inasmuch as, many
    of the tribes of Indians which I have met with, furnish manners and
    customs which have awakened my enthusiasm, and afforded me interesting
    materials for my Gallery.</p>

  <p>To give to the reader a better idea of the character of the scenes
    which I have above described, along the stately shores of the Upper
    Mississippi, I have here inserted a river view taken about one hundred
    miles below this place (<a href="#i_228"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 228</a>); and another of “Dubuque’s
    Grave” (<a href="#i_229"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 229</a>) about equi-distant between this and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis; and both fairly setting forth the predominant character of the
    shores of the Upper Mississippi, which are every where covered, as far
    as the eye can behold, with a green turf, and occasional forest trees,
    as seen in the drawings.</p>

  <p><em>Dubuque’s Grave</em> is a place of great notoriety on this river, in
    consequence of its having been the residence and mining place of the
    first lead mining pioneer of these regions, by the name of Dubuque, who
    held his title under a grant from the Mexican Government (I think), and
    settled by the side of this huge bluff, on the pinnacle of which he
    erected the tomb to receive his own body, and placed over it a cross
    with his own inscription on it. After his death, his body was placed
    within the tomb, at his request, lying in state (and uncovered except
    with his winding-sheet), upon a large flat stone, where it was exposed
    to the view, as his bones now are, to the gaze, of every traveller who
    takes the pains to ascend this beautiful, grassy and lilly-covered
    mound to the top, and peep through the gratings of two little windows,
    which have admitted the eyes, but stopped the sacrilegious <em>hands</em>
    of thousands who have taken a walk to it.</p>

  <p>At the foot of this bluff, there is now an extensive smelting furnace,
    where vast quantities of lead are melted from the ores which are dug
    out of the hills in all directions about it.</p>

  <p>The <em>Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony</em> (<a href="#i_230"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 230</a>), which is 900 miles
    above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, is the natural curiosity of this country, and nine
    miles above the mouth of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, from whence I am at this time
    writing. At this place, on the point of land between the Mississippi
    and the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters rivers, the United States’ Government have erected
    a strong Fort, which has taken the name of Fort Snelling, from the
    name of a distinguished and most excellent officer of that name, who
    superintended the building of it. The site of this Fort is one of the
    most judicious that could have been selected in the country, both for
    health and defence; and being on an elevation of 100 feet or more above
    the water, has an exceedingly bold and picturesque effect, as seen in
    <a href="#i_231"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 231</a>.</p>

  <p>This Fort is generally occupied by a regiment of men placed here to
    keep the peace amongst the Sioux and Chippeways, who occupy the country
    about it, and also for the purpose of protecting the citizens on the
    frontier.</p>

  <p>The Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony is about nine miles above this Fort, and the
    junction of the two rivers; and, although a picturesque and spirited
    scene, is but a pigmy in size to Niagara, and other cataracts in our
    country—the actual perpendicular fall being but eighteen feet, though
    of half a mile or so in extent, which is the width of the river; with
    brisk and leaping rapids above and below, giving life and spirit to the
    scene.</p>

  <p>The Sioux who live in the vicinity of the Falls, and occupy all the
    country about here, West of the Mississippi, are a part of the great
    tribe on the Upper Missouri; and the same in most of their customs,
    yet very dissimilar in personal appearance, from the changes which
    civilized examples have wrought upon them. I mentioned in a former
    Letter, that the country of the Sioux, extended from the base of the
    Rocky Mountains to the banks of the Mississippi; and for the whole of
    that way, it is more or less settled by this immense tribe, bounding
    the East side of their country by the Mississippi River.</p>

  <p>The Sioux in these parts, who are out of reach of the beavers and
    buffaloes, are poor and very meanly clad, compared to those on the
    Missouri, where they are in the midst of those and other wild animals,
    whose skins supply them with picturesque and comfortable dresses. The
    same deterioration also is seen in the morals and constitutions of
    these, as amongst all other Indians, who live along the frontiers, in
    the vicinity of our settlements, where whiskey is sold to them, and the
    small-pox and other diseases are introduced to shorten their lives.</p>

  <p>The principal bands of the Sioux that visit this place, and who live in
    the vicinity of it, are those known as the Black Dog’s band—Red Wing’s
    band, and Wa-be-sha’s band; each band known in common parlance, by the
    name of its chief, as I have mentioned. The Black Dog’s band reside but
    a few miles above Fort Snelling, on the banks of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, and
    number some five or six hundred. The Red Wing’s band are at the head of
    Lake Pepin, sixty miles below this place on the West side of the river.
    And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> Wa-be-sha’s band and village are some sixty or more miles below
    Lake Pepin on the West side of the river, on a beautiful prairie, known
    (and ever will be) by the name of “Wa-be-sha’s prairie.” Each of these
    bands, and several others that live in this section of country, exhibit
    considerable industry in their agricultural pursuits, raising very
    handsome corn-fields, laying up their food, thus procured, for their
    subsistence during the long and tedious winters.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the inhabitants of these bands are assembled here
    at this time, affording us, who are visitors here, a fine and wild
    scene of dances, amusements, &amp;c. They seem to take great pleasure in
    “showing off” in these scenes, to the amusement of the many fashionable
    visitors, both ladies and gentlemen, who are in the habit of reaching
    this post, as steamers are arriving at this place every week in the
    summer from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.</p>

  <p>Many of the customs of these people create great surprise in the minds
    of the travellers of the East, who here have the first satisfactory
    opportunity of seeing them; and none, I observe, has created more
    surprise, and pleasure also, particularly amongst the ladies, than
    the mode of carrying their infants, slung on their backs, in their
    beautifully ornamented cradles.</p>

  <p>The custom of carrying the child thus is not peculiar to this tribe,
    but belongs alike to all, as far as I have yet visited them; and also
    as far as I have been able to learn from travellers, who have been
    amongst tribes that I have not yet seen. The child in its earliest
    infancy, has its back lashed to a straight board, being fastened to
    it by bandages, which pass around it in front, and on the back of the
    board they are tightened to the necessary degree by lacing strings,
    which hold it in a straight and healthy position, with its feet resting
    on a broad hoop, which passes around the foot of the cradle, and the
    child’s position (as it rides about on its mother’s back, supported by
    a broad strap that passes across her forehead), that of standing erect,
    which, no doubt, has a tendency to produce straight limbs, sound lungs,
    and long life. In <a href="#i_232"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 232</a>, letter <i>a</i>, is a correct
    drawing of a Sioux cradle, which is in my Collection, and was purchased
    from a Sioux woman’s back, as she was carrying her infant in it, as is
    seen in letter <i>d</i> of the same plate.</p>

  <p>In this instance, as is often the case, the bandages that pass around
    the cradle, holding the child in, are all the way covered with a
    beautiful embroidery of porcupine quills, with ingenious figures of
    horses, men, &amp;c. A broad hoop of elastic wood passes around in front of
    the child’s face, to protect it in case of a fall, from the front of
    which is suspended a little toy of exquisite embroidery, for the child
    to handle and amuse itself with. To this and other little trinkets
    hanging in front of it, there are attached many little tinselled and
    tinkling things, of the brightest colours, to amuse both the eyes and
    the ears of the child. Whilst travelling on horseback, the arms of
    the child are fastened under the bandages, so as not to be endangered
    if the cradle falls; and when at rest, they are generally taken out,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>allowing the infant to reach and amuse itself with the little toys
    and trinkets that are placed before it, and within its reach. This
    seems like a cruel mode, but I am inclined to believe that it is a
    very good one for the people who use it, and well adapted to the
    circumstances under which they live; in support of which opinion, I
    offer the universality of the custom, which has been practiced for
    centuries amongst all the tribes of North America, as a legitimate and
    very strong reason. It is not true that amongst all the tribes the
    cradle will be found so much ornamented as in the present instance; but
    the model is essentially the same, as well as the mode of carrying it.</p>

  <figure class="illowp75 mt2" id="i_232">
    <div class="plate"><i>131</i></div>
    <img src="images/i_232.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>232</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>Along the frontiers, where the Indians have been ridiculed for the
    custom, as they are for everything that is not <em>civil</em> about them,
    they have in many instances departed from it; but even there, they will
    generally be seen lugging their child about in this way, when they have
    abandoned almost every other native custom, and are too poor to cover
    it with more than rags and strings, which fasten it to its cradle.</p>

  <p>The infant is carried in this manner until it is five, six or seven
    months old, after which it is carried on the back, in the manner
    represented in two of the figures of the same plate, and held within
    the folds of the robe of blanket.</p>

  <p>The modes of carrying the infant when riding, are also here shewn, and
    the manner in which the women ride, which, amongst all the tribes, is
    <em>astride</em>, in the same manner as that practiced by the men.</p>

  <p>Letter <i>b</i> in the same plate is a <em>mourning cradle</em>, and
    opens to the view of the reader another very curious and interesting
    custom. If the infant dies during the time that is allotted to it to
    be carried in this cradle, it is buried, and the disconsolate mother
    fills the cradle with black quills and feathers, in the parts which
    the child’s body had occupied, and in this way carries it around
    with her wherever she goes for a year or more, with as much care as
    if her infant were alive and in it; and she often lays or stands it
    leaning against the side of the wigwam, where she is all day engaged
    in her needle-work, and chatting and talking to it as familiarly and
    affectionately as if it were her loved infant, instead of its shell,
    that she was talking to. So lasting and so strong is the affection of
    these women for the lost child, that it matters not how heavy or cruel
    their load, or how rugged the route they have to pass over, they will
    faithfully carry this, and carefully from day to day, and even more
    strictly perform their duties to it, than if the child were alive and
    in it.</p>

  <p>In the little toy that I have mentioned, and which is suspended before
    the child’s face, is carefully and superstitiously preserved the
    <em>umbilicus</em>, which is always secured at the time of its birth,
    and being rolled up into a little wad of the size of a pea, and dried,
    it is enclosed in the centre of this little bag, and placed before the
    child’s face, as its protector and its security for “<em>good luck</em>”
    and long life. Letter <i>c</i>, same plate, exhibits a number of
    forms and different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> tastes of several of these little toys, which I
    have purchased from the women, which they were very willing to sell
    for a trifling present; but in every instance, they cut them open,
    and removed from within a bunch of cotton or moss, the little sacred
    <em>medicine</em>, which, to part with, would be to “endanger the health
    of the child”—a thing that no consideration would have induced them in
    any instance to have done.</p>

  <p>My brush has been busily employed at this place, as in others; and
    amongst the dignitaries that I have painted, is, first and foremost,
    <em>Wa-nah-de-tunck-a</em> (the big eagle), commonly called the “Black
    Dog” (<a href="#i_234"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 234</a>). This is a very noted man, and chief of the
    <em>O-hah-kas-ka-toh-y-an-te</em> (long avenue) band.</p>

  <p>By the side of him <em>Toh-to-wah-kon-da-pee</em> (the blue
    medicine—<a href="#i_233"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 233</a>), a noted medicine-man, of the
    Ting-tah-to-a band; with his medicine or mystery drum, made of
    deer-skins; and his mystery rattles made of antelopes’ hoofs, in his
    hands. This notorious old man was professionally a doctor in his tribe,
    but not very distinguished, until my friend Dr. Jarvis, who is surgeon
    for the post, very liberally dealt out from the public medicine-chest,
    occasional “odds and ends” to him, and with a <em>professional
    concern</em> for the poor old fellow’s success, instructed him in
    the modes of their application; since which, the effects of his
    prescriptions have been so decided amongst his tribe, whom he holds in
    ignorance of his aid in his mysterious operations; that he has risen
    quite rapidly into notice, within the few last years, in the vicinity
    of the Fort; where he finds it most easy to carry out his new mode of
    practice, for reasons above mentioned.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">plates</span> 235 and 236, there are portraits of the two
    most distinguished ball-players in the Sioux tribe, whose names
    are <em>Ah-no-je-nahge</em> (he who stands on both sides), and
    <em>We-chush-ta-doo-ta</em> (the red man). Both of these young men stood
    to me for their portraits, in the dresses precisely in which they are
    painted; with their ball-sticks in their hands, and in the attitudes of
    the play. We have had several very spirited plays here within the few
    past days; and each of these young men came from the ball-play ground
    to my painting-room, in the dress in which they had just struggled in
    the play.</p>

  <p>It will be seen by these sketches, that the custom in this tribe,
    differs in some respects from that of the Choctaws and other Southern
    tribes, of which I have before spoken; and I there showed that they
    played with a stick in each hand, when the Sioux use but one stick,
    which is generally held in both hands, with a round hoop at the end, in
    which the ball is caught and thrown with wonderful tact; a much more
    difficult feat, I should think, than that of the Choctaws, who catch
    the ball between two sticks. The tail also, in this tribe, differs,
    inasmuch as it is generally made of quills, instead of white horsehair,
    as described amongst the Choctaws. In other respects, the rules and
    manner of the game are the same as amongst those tribes.</p>

  <p>Several others of the <i lang="fr">distingués</i> of the tribe, I have also
    painted here, and must needs refer the reader to the Museum for further
    information of them.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT SNELLING, <i>FALL OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> ANTHONY</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> fourth of July was hailed and celebrated by us at this place, in
    an unusual, and not uninteresting manner. With the presence of several
    hundreds of the wildest of the Chippeways, and as many hundreds of the
    Sioux; we were prepared with material in abundance for the novel—for
    the wild and grotesque,—as well as for the grave and ludicrous. Major
    Talliafferro, the Indian agent, to aid my views in procuring sketches
    of manners and customs, represented to them that I was a great
    <em>medicine-man</em>, who had visited, and witnessed the sports of, a
    vast many Indians of different tribes, and had come to see whether
    the Sioux and Chippeways were equal in a ball-play, &amp;c. to their
    neighbours; and that if they would come in on the <em>next</em> day
    (fourth of July), and give us a ball-play, and some of their dances,
    in their best style, he would have the <em>big gun</em> fired twenty-one
    times (the customary salute for that day), which they easily construed
    into a high compliment to themselves. This, with still stronger
    inducements, a barrel of flour—a quantity of pork and tobacco, which
    I gave them, brought the scene about on the day of independence, as
    follows:—About eleven o’clock (the usual time for Indians to make their
    appearance on any great occasion), the young men, who were enlisted
    for ball-play, made their appearance on the ground with ball-sticks
    in hand—with no other dress on than the flap, and attached to a
    girdle or ornamental sash, a tail, extending nearly to the ground,
    made of the choicest arrangement of quills and feathers, or of the
    hair of white horses’ tails. After an excited and warmly contested
    play of two hours, they adjourned to a place in front of the agent’s
    office, where they entertained us for two or three hours longer, with
    a continued variety of their most fanciful and picturesque dances.
    They gave us the <em>beggar’s dance</em>—the <em>buffalo-dance</em>—the
    <em>bear-dance</em>—the <em>eagle-dance</em>—and <em>dance of the
    braves</em>. This last is peculiarly beautiful, and exciting to the
    feelings in the highest degree.</p>

  <p>At intervals they stop, and one of them steps into the ring,
    and vociferates as loud as possible, with the most significant
    gesticulations, the feats of bravery which he has performed during
    his life—he boasts of the scalps he has taken—of the enemies he has
    vanquished, and at the same time carries his body through all the
    motions and gestures, which have been used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> during these scenes when
    they were transacted. At the end of his boasting, all assent to the
    truth of his story, and give in their approbation by the guttural
    “<em>waugh!</em>” and the dance again commences. At the next interval,
    another makes his boasts, and another, and another, and so on.</p>

  <p>During this scene, a little trick was played off in the following
    manner, which produced much amusement and laughter. A woman of goodly
    size, and in woman’s attire, danced into the ring (which seemed to
    excite some surprise, as women are never allowed to join in the dance),
    and commenced “sawing the air,” and boasting of the astonishing feats
    of bravery she had performed—of the incredible number of horses she had
    stolen—of the scalps she had taken, &amp;c. &amp;c.; until her feats surpassed
    all that had ever been heard of—sufficient to put all the warriors
    who had boasted, to the blush. They all gave assent, however, to what
    she had said, and apparently <em>credence</em> too; and to reward so
    extraordinary a feat of female prowess, they presented to her a kettle,
    a cradle, beads, ribbons, &amp;c. After getting her presents, and placing
    them safely in the hands of another matron for safe keeping, she
    commenced disrobing herself; and, almost instantly divesting herself
    of a loose dress, in the presence of the whole company, came out in
    a <em>soldier’s coat</em> and <em>pantaloons</em>! and laughed at them
    excessively for their mistake! She then commenced dancing and making
    her boasts of her exploits, assuring them that she was a man, and a
    great brave. They all gave unqualified assent to this, acknowledged
    their error, and made her other presents of a gun, a horse, of
    tobacco, and a war-club. After her boasts were done, and the presents
    secured as before, she deliberately threw off the pantaloons and
    coat, and presented herself at once, and to their great astonishment
    and confusion, in a beautiful woman’s dress. The tact with which she
    performed these parts, so uniformly pleased, that it drew forth
    thundering applause from the Indians, as well as from the spectators;
    and the chief stepped up and crowned her head with a beautiful plume
    of the eagle’s quill, rising from a crest of the swan’s down. My wife,
    who was travelling this part of the country with me, was a spectator of
    these scenes, as well as the ladies and officers of the garrison, whose
    polite hospitality we are at this time enjoying.</p>

  <p>Several days after this, the plains of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony,
    rang with the continual sounds of drums and rattles, in time with
    the thrilling yells of the dance, until it had doubly ceased to be
    novelty. General Patterson, of Philadelphia, and his family arrived
    about this time, however, and a dance was got up for their amusement;
    and it proved to be one of an unusual kind, and interesting to all.
    Considerable preparation was made for the occasion, and the Indians
    informed me, that if they could get a couple of dogs that were of no
    use about the garrison, they would give us their favourite, the “<em>dog
    dance</em>.” The two dogs were soon produced by the officers, and in
    presence of the whole assemblage of spectators, they butchered them and
    placed their two hearts and livers entire and uncooked, on a couple of
    crotches about as high as a man’s face (<a href="#i_237"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 237</a>). These were
    then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>cut into strips, about an inch in width, and left hanging in
    this condition, with the blood and smoke upon them. A spirited dance
    then ensued; and, in a confused manner, every one sung forth his own
    deeds of bravery in ejaculatory gutturals, which were almost deafening;
    and they danced up, two at a time to the stakes, and after spitting
    several times upon the liver and hearts, catched a piece in their
    mouths, bit it off, and swallowed it. This was all done without losing
    the step (which was in time to their music), or interrupting the times
    of their voices.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>134</i></div>
  <figure id="i_237">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/i_237.jpg" alt="" />
    <figcaption>237</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>Each and every one of them in this wise bit off and swallowed a piece
    of the livers, until they were demolished; with the exception of the
    two last pieces hanging on the stakes, which a couple of them carried
    in their mouths, and communicated to the mouths of the two musicians
    who swallowed them. This is one of the most valued dances amongst
    the Sioux, though by no means the most beautiful or most pleasing.
    The beggar’s dance, the discovery dance, and the eagle dance, are
    far more graceful and agreeable. The <em>dog dance</em> is one of
    <em>distinction</em>, inasmuch as it can only be danced by those who have
    taken scalps from the enemy’s heads, and come forward boasting, that
    they killed their enemy in battle, and swallowed a piece of his heart
    in the same manner.</p>

  <p>As the Sioux own and occupy all the country on the West bank of the
    river in this vicinity; so do the Chippeways claim all lying East, from
    the mouth of the Chippeway River, at the outlet of Lake Pepin, to the
    source of the Mississippi; and within the month past, there have been
    one thousand or more of them encamped here, on business with the Indian
    agent and Sioux, with whom they have recently had some difficulty.
    These two hostile foes, who have, time out of mind, been continually
    at war, are now encamped here, on different sides of the Fort; and all
    difficulties having been arranged by their agent, in whose presence
    they have been making their speeches, for these two weeks past, have
    been indulging in every sort of their amusements, uniting in their
    dances, ball-plays and other games; and feasting and smoking together,
    only to raise the war-cry and the tomahawk again, when they get upon
    their hunting grounds.</p>

  <p>Major Talliafferro is the Government agent for the Sioux at this place,
    and furnishes the only instance probably, of a public servant on these
    frontiers, who has performed the duties of his office, strictly and
    faithfully, as well as kindly, for fifteen years. The Indians think
    much of him, and call him Great Father, to whose advice they listen
    with the greatest attention.</p>

  <p>The encampment of the Chippeways, to which I have been a daily visitor,
    was built in the manner seen in <a href="#i_238"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 238</a>; their wigwams made
    of birch bark, covering the frame work, which was of slight poles stuck
    in the ground, and bent over at the top, so as to give a rooflike shape
    to the lodge, best calculated to ward off rain and winds.</p>

  <p>Through this curious scene I was strolling a few days since with my
    wife, and I observed the Indian women gathering around her, anxious to
    shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> hands with her, and shew her their children, of which she took
    especial notice; and they literally filled her hands and her arms, with
    <em>muk-kuks</em> of maple sugar which they manufacture, and had brought
    in, in great quantities for sale.</p>

  <p>After the business and amusements of this great Treaty between the
    Chippeways and Sioux were all over, the Chippeways struck their tents
    by taking them down and rolling up their bark coverings, which, with
    their bark canoes seen in the picture, turned up amongst their wigwams,
    were carried to the water’s edge; and all things being packed in, men,
    women, dogs, and all, were swiftly propelled by paddles to the Fall of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, where we had repaired to witness their mode of passing
    the cataract, by “<em>making</em> (as it is called) <em>the portage</em>,”
    which we found to be a very curious scene; and was done by running all
    their canoes into an eddy below the Fall, and as near as they could get
    by paddling; when all were landed, and every thing taken out of the
    canoes (<a href="#i_239"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 239</a>), and with them carried by the women, around
    the Fall, and half a mile or so above, where the canoes were put into
    the water again; and goods and chattels being loaded in, and all hands
    seated, the paddles were again put to work, and the light and bounding
    crafts upon their voyage.</p>

  <p>The bark canoe of the Chippeways is, perhaps, the most beautiful and
    light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented. They
    are generally made complete with the rind of one birch tree, and so
    ingeniously shaped and sewed together, with roots of the tamarack,
    which they call <em>wat-tap</em>, that they are water-tight, and ride
    upon the water, as light as a cork. They gracefully lean and dodge
    about, under the skilful balance of an Indian, or the ugliest squaw;
    but like everything wild, are timid and treacherous under the guidance
    of white man; and, if he be not an experienced equilibrist, he is sure
    to get two or three times soused, in his first endeavours at familiar
    acquaintance with them. In <a href="#i_240"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 240</a>, letter <i>a</i>, the
    reader will see two specimens of these canoes correctly drawn; where
    he can contrast them and their shapes, with the log canoe, letter
    <i>b</i>, (or “dug out,” as it is often called in the Western regions)
    of the Sioux, and many other tribes; which is dug out of a solid log,
    with great labour, by these ignorant people, who have but few tools to
    work with.</p>

  <p>In the same plate, letter <i>c</i>, I have also introduced the skin
    canoes of the Mandans, (of the Upper Missouri, of whom I have spoken
    in Volume I), which are made almost round like a tub, by straining a
    buffalo’s skin over a frame of wicker work, made of willow or other
    boughs. The woman in paddling these awkward tubs, stands in the bow,
    and makes the stroke with the paddle, by reaching it forward in the
    water and drawing it to her, by which means she pulls the canoe along
    with some considerable speed. These very curious and rudely constructed
    canoes, are made in the form of the <em>Welsh coracle</em>; and, if I
    mistake not, propelled in the same manner, which is a very curious
    circumstance; inasmuch as they are found in the heart of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>the
    great wilderness of America, when all the other surrounding tribes
    construct their canoes in decidedly different forms, and of different
    materials.</p>

  <p>In the same plate, letter <i>d</i>, is a pair of Sioux (and in letter
    <i>e</i>, of Chippeway) <em>snow shoes</em>, which are used in the deep
    snows of the winter, under the Indians’ feet, to buoy him up as he
    runs in pursuit of his game. The hoops or frames of these are made of
    elastic wood, and the webbing, of strings of rawhide, which form such
    a resistance to the snow, as to carry them over without sinking into
    it; and enabling them to come up with their game, which is wallowing
    through the drifts, and easily overtaken; as in the buffalo hunt, in
    <span class="smcap">plate</span> 109, Volume I.</p>

  <p>Of the portraits of chiefs and others I have painted amongst the
    Chippeways at this place, two distinguished young men will be seen in
    <span class="smcap">plates</span> <a href="#i_241">241</a>, <a href="#i_242">242</a>. The first by the name of <em>Ka-bes-kunk</em>
    (he who travels everywhere), the other, <em>Ka-be-mub-be</em> (he who
    sits everywhere), both painted at full length, in full dress, and just
    as they were adorned and equipped, even to a quill and a trinket.</p>

  <p>The first of these two young men is, no doubt, one of the most
    remarkable of his age to be found in the tribe. Whilst he was standing
    for his portrait, which was in one of the officer’s quarters in the
    Fort, where there were some ten or fifteen of his enemies the Sioux,
    seated on the floor around the room; he told me to take particular
    pains in representing eight quills which were arranged in his
    head-dress, which he said stood for so many Sioux scalps that he had
    taken with his left hand, in which he was grasping his war-club, with
    which hand he told me he was in the habit of making all his blows.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_244"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 244</a>, is the portrait of a warrior by the name
    of <em>Ot-ta-wa</em> (the otaway), ——— with his pipe in his hand;
    and in <a href="#i_244"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 245</a>, the portrait of a Chippeway woman,
    <em>Ju-ah-kis-gaw</em>, with her child in its crib or cradle. In a former
    Letter I gave a minute account of the Sioux cradle, and here the reader
    sees the very similar mode amongst the Chippeways; and as in all
    instances that can be found, the <em>ni-ahkust-ahg</em> (or umbilicus)
    hanging before the child’s face for its supernatural protector.</p>

  <p>This woman’s dress was mostly made of civilized manufactures, but
    curiously decorated and ornamented according to Indian taste.</p>

  <p>Many were the dances given to me on different places, of which I may
    make further use and further mention on future occasions: but of
    which I shall name but one at present, the <em>snow-shoe dance</em>
    (<a href="#i_243"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 243</a>), which is exceedingly picturesque, being danced
    with the snow shoes under the feet, at the falling of the first snow
    in the beginning of winter; when they sing a song of thanksgiving to
    the Great Spirit for sending them a return of snow, when they can run
    on their snow shoes in their valued hunts and easily take the game for
    their food.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

  <p>About this lovely spot I have whiled away a few months with great
    pleasure, and having visited all the curiosities, and all the different
    villages of Indians in the vicinity, I close my note-book and start in
    a few days for Prairie du Chien, which is 300 miles below this; where I
    shall have new subjects for my brush and new themes for my pen, when I
    may continue my epistles. Adieu.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CAMP DES MOINES.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after the date of my last Letter, written at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, having
    placed my wife on board of the steamer, with a party of ladies, for
    Prairie du Chien, I embarked in a light bark canoe, on my homeward
    course, with only one companion, Corporal Allen, from the garrison;
    a young man of considerable taste, who thought he could relish the
    transient scenes of a voyage in company with a painter, having gained
    the indulgence of Major Bliss, the commanding officer, with permission
    to accompany me.</p>

  <p>With stores laid in for a ten days’ voyage, and armed for any
    emergency—with sketch-book and colours prepared, we shoved off and
    swiftly glided away with paddles nimbly plied, resolved to see and
    relish every thing curious or beautiful that fell in our way. We
    lingered along, among the scenes of grandeur which presented themselves
    amid the thousand bluffs, and arrived at Prairie du Chien in about
    ten days, in good plight, without accident or incident of a thrilling
    nature, with the exception of one instance which happened about thirty
    miles below <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, and on the first day of our journey. In the
    after part of the day, we discovered three lodges of Sioux Indians
    encamped on the bank, all hallooing and waving their blankets for us
    to come in, to the shore. We had no business with them, and resolved
    to keep on our course, when one of them ran into his lodge, and coming
    out with his gun in his hand, levelled it at us, and gave us a charge
    of buck-shot about our ears. One of them struck in my canoe, passing
    through several folds of my cloak, which was folded, and lying just in
    front of my knee, and several others struck so near on each side as
    to spatter the water into our faces. There was no fun in this, and I
    then ran my canoe to the shore as fast as possible—they all ran, men,
    women, and children, to the water’s edge, meeting us with yells and
    laughter as we landed. As the canoe struck the shore, I rose violently
    from my seat, and throwing all the infuriated demon I could into my
    face—thrusting my pistols into my belt—a half dozen bullets into my
    mouth—and my double-barrelled gun in my hand—I leaped ashore and chased
    the lot of them from the beach, throwing myself, by a nearer route,
    between them and their wigwams, where I kept them for some time at a
    stand, with my barrels presented, and threats (corroborated with looks
    which they could not misunderstand) that I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> annihilate the whole
    of them in a minute. As the gun had been returned to the lodge, and the
    man who fired it could not be identified, the rascal’s life was thereby
    probably prolonged. We stood for some time in this position, and no
    explanation could be made, other than that which could be read from the
    lip and the brow, a language which is the same, and read alike, among
    all nations. I slipped my sketch-book and pencil into my hand, and
    under the muzzle of my gun, each fellow stood for his likeness, which I
    made them understand, by signs, were to be sent to “Muzzabucksa” (iron
    cutter), the name they gave to Major Talliafferro, their agent at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Peters.</p>

  <p>This threat, and the continued vociferation of the corporal from the
    canoe, that I was a “Grande Capitaine,” seemed considerably to alarm
    them. I at length gradually drew myself off, but with a lingering eye
    upon the sneaking rascals, who stood in sullen silence, with one eye
    upon me, and the other upon the corporal; who I found had held them at
    bay from the bow of his canoe, with his musket-levelled upon them—his
    bayonet fixed—his cartouch box slung, with one eye in full blaze over
    the barrel, and the other drawn down within two parts of an inch of the
    upper corner of his mouth. At my approach, his muscles were gradually
    (but somewhat reluctantly) relaxed. We seated ourselves, and quietly
    dipped our paddles again on our way.</p>

  <p>Some allowance must be made for this outrage, and many others that
    could be named, that have taken place amongst that part of the Sioux
    nation; they have been for many years past made drunkards, by the
    solicitations of white men, and then abused, and their families also;
    for which, when they are drunk (as in the present instance), they
    are often ready, and disposed to retaliate and to return insult for
    injuries.</p>

  <p>We went on peaceably and pleasantly during the rest of our voyage,
    having ducks, deer, and bass for our game and our food; our bed was
    generally on the grass at the foot of some towering bluff, where,
    in the melancholy stillness of night, we were lulled to sleep by
    the liquid notes of the whip-poor-will; and after his warbling
    ceased, roused by the mournful complaints of the starving wolf, or
    <em>surprised</em> by the startling interrogation, “who! who! who!” by
    the winged monarch of the dark.</p>

  <p>There is a something that fills and feeds the mind of an enthusiastic
    man, when he is thrown upon natural resources, amidst the rude
    untouched scenes of nature, which cannot be described; and I leave the
    world to imagine the feelings of pleasure with which I found myself
    again out of the din of artful life, among scenes of grandeur worthy
    the whole soul’s devotion, and admiration.</p>

  <p>When the morning’s dew was shaken off, our coffee enjoyed—our light
    bark again launched upon the water, and the chill of the morning
    banished by the quick stroke of the paddle, and the busy chaunt of
    the corporal’s boat-song, our ears and our eyes were open to the rude
    scenes of romance that were about us—our light boat ran to every
    ledge—dodged into every slough or “<em>cut-off</em>” to be seen—every
    mineral was examined—every cave explored—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> almost every bluff
    of grandeur ascended to the top. These towering edifices of nature,
    which will stand the admiration of thousands and tens of thousands,
    unchanged and unchangeable, though grand and majestic to the eye of the
    passing traveller, will be found to inspire new ideas of magnitude when
    attempted to be travelled to the top. From the tops of many of them I
    have sketched for the information of the world, and for the benefit
    of those who travel much, I would recommend a trip to the Summit of
    “Pike’s Tent” (the highest bluff on the river), 100 miles above Prairie
    du Chien; to the top also of “La Montaigne qui tromps a l’eau”—the
    summit of Bad Axe Mountain—and a look over Lake Pepin’s turretted
    shores from the top of the bluff opposite to the “Lover’s Leap,” being
    the highest on the lake, and the point from which the greater part of
    its shores can be seen.</p>

  <p>Along the shores of this beautiful lake we lingered for several days,
    and our canoe was hauled a hundred times upon the pebbly beach, where
    we spent hours and days, robbing it of its precious gems, which are
    thrown up by the waves. We found many rich agates, carnelians, jaspers,
    and porphyrys. The agates are many of them peculiarly beautiful, most
    of them water-waved—their colours brilliant and beautifully striated.
    “Point aux Sables” has been considered the most productive part of
    the lake for these gems; but owing to the frequent landings of the
    steam-boats and other craft on that point, the best specimens of them
    have been picked up; and the traveller will now be best remunerated for
    his trouble, by tracing the shore around into some of its coves, or on
    some of its points less frequented by the footsteps of man.</p>

  <p>The <em>Lover’s Leap</em> (<a href="#i_248"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 248</a>), is a bold and projecting
    rock, of six or seven hundred feet elevation on the East side of
    the lake, from the summit of which, it is said, a beautiful Indian
    girl, the daughter of a chief, threw herself off in presence of her
    tribe, some fifty years ago, and dashed herself to pieces, to avoid
    being married to a man whom her father had decided to be her husband,
    and whom she would not marry. On our way, after we had left the
    beautiful shores of Lake Pepin, we passed the magnificent bluff called
    “<em>Pike’s Tent</em>” (<a href="#i_249"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 249</a>), and undoubtedly, the highest
    eminence on the river, running up in the form of a tent; from which
    circumstance, and that of having first been ascended by Lieutenant
    Pike, it has taken the name of Pike’s Tent, which it will, doubtless,
    for ever retain.</p>

  <p>The corporal and I run our little craft to the base of this stupendous
    pyramid, and spent half a day about its sides and its pinnacle,
    admiring the lovely and almost boundless landscape that lies beneath it.</p>

  <p>To the top of this grass-covered mound I would advise every traveller
    in the country, who has the leisure to do it, and sinew enough in his
    leg, to stroll awhile, and enjoy what it may be difficult for him to
    see elsewhere.</p>

  <p>“<em>Cap au l’ail</em>” (Garlic Cape, <a href="#i_250"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 250</a>), about twenty
    miles above Prairie du Chien is another beautiful scene—and the
    “Cornice Rocks”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> (<a href="#i_251"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 251</a>), on the West bank, where my
    little bark rested two days, till the corporal and I had taken bass
    from every nook and eddy about them, where our hooks could be dipped.
    To the lover of fine fish, and fine sport in fishing, I would recommend
    an encampment for a few days on this picturesque ledge, where his
    appetite and his passion will be soon gratified.</p>

  <p>Besides these picturesque scenes, I made drawings also of all the
    Indian villages on the way, and of many other interesting points, which
    are curious in my Collection, but too numerous to introduce in this
    place.</p>

  <p>In the midst, or half-way of Lake Pepin, which is an expansion of the
    river of four or five miles in width, and twenty-five miles in length,
    the corporal and I hauled our canoe out upon the beach of Point aux
    Sables, where we spent a couple of days, feasting on plums and fine
    fish and wild fowl, and filling our pockets with agates and carnelians
    we were picking up along the pebbly beach; and at last, started on
    our way for the outlet of the lake, with a fair North West wind,
    which wafted us along in a delightful manner, as I sat in the stern
    and steered, while the corporal was “catching the breeze” in a large
    umbrella, which he spread open and held in the bow. We went merrily
    and exultingly on in this manner, until at length the wind increased
    to anything but a gale; and the waves were foaming white, and dashing
    on the shores where we could not land without our frail bark being
    broken to pieces. We soon became alarmed, and saw that our only safety
    was in keeping on the course that we were running at a rapid rate, and
    that with our sail full set, to brace up and steady our boat on the
    waves, while we kept within swimming distance of the shore, resolved
    to run into the first cove, or around the first point we could find
    for our protection. We kept at an equal distance from the shore—and in
    this most critical condition, the wind drove us ten or fifteen miles,
    without a landing-place, till we exultingly steered into the mouth of
    the Chippeway river, at the outlet of the lake, where we soon found
    quiet and safety; but found our canoe in a sinking condition, being
    half full of water, and having three of the five of her beams or braces
    broken out, with which serious disasters, a few rods more of the fuss
    and confusion would have sent us to the bottom. We here laid by part
    of a day, and having repaired our disasters, wended our way again
    pleasantly and successfully on.</p>

  <p>At Prairie du Chien, which is near the mouth of the Ouisconsin River,
    and 600 miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, where we safely landed my canoe, I
    found my wife enjoying the hospitality of Mrs. Judge Lockwood, who had
    been a schoolmate of mine in our childhood, and is now residing with
    her interesting family in that place. Under her hospitable roof we
    spent a few weeks with great satisfaction, after which my wife took
    steamer for Dubuque, and I took to my little bark canoe alone (having
    taken leave of the corporal), which I paddled to this place, quite
    leisurely—cooking my own meat, and having my own fun as I passed along.</p>

  <p>Prairie du Chien (<a href="#i_253"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 253</a>) has been one of the earliest
    and principal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>trading posts of the Fur Company, and they now
    have a large establishment at that place; but doing far less business
    than formerly, owing to the great mortality of the Indians in its
    vicinity, and the destruction of the game, which has almost entirely
    disappeared in these regions. The prairie is a beautiful elevation
    above the river, of several miles in length, and a mile or so in
    width, with a most picturesque range of grassy bluffs encompassing it
    in the rear. The Government have erected there a substantial Fort, in
    which are generally stationed three or four companies of men, for the
    purpose (as at the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony) of keeping the peace amongst
    the hostile tribes, and also of protecting the frontier inhabitants
    from the attacks of the excited savages. There are on the prairie some
    forty or fifty families, mostly French, and some half-breeds, whose
    lives have been chiefly spent in the arduous and hazardous occupations
    of trappers, and traders, and voyageurs; which has well qualified them
    for the modes of dealing with Indians, where they have settled down and
    stand ready to compete with one another for their shares of annuities,
    &amp;c. which are dealt out to the different tribes who concentrate at that
    place, and are easily drawn from the poor Indians’ hands by whiskey and
    useless gewgaws.</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>141</i></div>

    <figcaption>253</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p>The consequence of this system is, that there is about that place,
    almost one continual scene of wretchedness, and drunkenness, and
    disease amongst the Indians, who come there to trade and to receive
    their annuities, that disgusts and sickens the heart of every stranger
    that extends his travels to it.</p>

  <p>When I was there, Wa-be-sha’s band of the Sioux came there, and
    remained several weeks to get their annuities, which, when they
    received them, fell (as they always will do), far short of paying off
    the account, which the Traders take good care to have standing against
    them for goods furnished them on a year’s credit. However, whether
    they pay off or not, they can always get whiskey enough for a grand
    carouse and a brawl, which lasts for a week or two, and almost sure to
    terminate the lives of some of their numbers.</p>

  <p>At the end of one of these a few days since, after the men had enjoyed
    their surfeit of whiskey, and wanted a little more amusement, and felt
    disposed to indulge the weaker sex in a little recreation also; it was
    announced amongst them, and through the village, that the women were
    going to have a ball-play!</p>

  <p>For this purpose the men, in their very liberal trades they were making
    and filling their canoes with goods delivered to them on a year’s
    credit, laid out a great quantity of ribbons and calicoes, with other
    presents well adapted to the wants and desires of the women; which were
    hung on a pole resting on crotches, and guarded by an old man, who was
    to be judge and umpire of the play which was to take place amongst
    the women, who were divided into two equal parties, and were to play
    a desperate game of ball, for the valuable stakes that were hanging
    before them (<a href="#i_252"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 252</a>).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>In the ball-play of the women, they have two balls attached to the
    ends of a string, about a foot and a half long; and each woman has a
    short stick in each hand, on which she catches the string with the two
    balls, and throws them, endeavouring to force them over the goal of her
    own party. The men are more than half drunk, when they feel liberal
    enough to indulge the women in such an amusement; and take infinite
    pleasure in rolling about on the ground and laughing to excess, whilst
    the women are tumbling about in all attitudes, and scuffling for the
    ball. The game of “<em>hunt the slipper</em>,” even, loses its zest after
    witnessing one of these, which sometimes last for hours together; and
    often exhibits the hottest contest for the balls, exactly over the
    heads of the men; who, half from whiskey, and half from inclination,
    are laying in groups and flat upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Prairie du Chien is the concentrating place of the Winnebagoes and
    Menomonies, who inhabit the waters of the Ouisconsin and Fox Rivers,
    and the chief part of the country lying East of the Mississippi, and
    West of Green Bay.</p>

  <p>The <em>Winnebagoes</em> are the remnant of a once powerful and warlike
    tribe, but are now left in a country where they have neither beasts
    or men to war with; and are in a most miserable and impoverished
    condition. The numbers of this tribe do not exceed four thousand; and
    the most of them have sold even their guns and ammunition for whiskey.
    Like the Sioux and Menomonies that come in to this post, they have
    several times suffered severely with the small-pox, which has in fact
    destroyed the greater proportion of them.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_254"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 254</a>, will be seen the portrait of an old chief, who
    died a few years since; and who was for many years the head chief of
    the tribe, by the name of <em>Naw-kaw</em> (wood). This man has been much
    distinguished in his time, for his eloquence; and he desired me to
    paint him in the attitude of an orator, addressing his people.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_255"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 255</a>, is a distinguished man of the Winnebago tribe,
    by the name of <em>Wah-chee-hahs-ka</em> (the man who puts all out of
    doors), commonly called the “boxer.” The largest man of the tribe, with
    rattlesnakes’ skins on his arms, and his war-club in his hand.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_256"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 256</a> is seen a warrior, <em>Kaw-kaw-ne-choo-a</em>; and
    in <a href="#i_257"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 257</a> another, Wa-kon-zee-kaw (the snake), both at full
    length; and fair specimens of the tribe, who are generally a rather
    short and thick-set, square shouldered set of men, of great strength,
    and of decided character as brave and desperate in war.</p>

  <p>Besides the chief and warriors above-named, I painted the portraits
    of <em>Won-de-tow-a</em> (the wonder), <em>Wa-kon-chash-kaw</em> (he who
    comes on the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>thunder), <em>Nau-naw-pay-ee</em> (the soldier),
    <em>Span-e-o-nee-kaw</em> (the Spaniard), <em>Hoo-wan-ee-kaw</em> (the
    little elk), <em>No-ah-choo-she-kaw</em> (he who breaks the bushes), and
    <em>Naugh-haigh-ke-kaw</em> (he who moistens the wood), all distinguished
    men of the tribe; and all at full length, as they will be seen standing
    in my Collection.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">The MENOMONIES,</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Like the Winnebagoes, are the remnant of a much more numerous and
    independent tribe, but have been reduced and enervated by the use of
    whiskey and the ravages of the small-pox, and number at this time,
    something like three thousand, living chiefly on the banks of Fox
    River, and the Western shore of Green Bay. They visit Prairie du
    Chien, where their annuities are paid them; and they indulge in the
    <em>bane</em>, like the tribes that I have mentioned.</p>

  <p>Of this tribe, I have painted quite a number of their leading
    characters, and at the head of them all, <em>Mah-kee-me-teuv</em> (the
    grizzly bear, <a href="#i_258"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 258</a>), with a handsome pipe in his hand;
    and by the side of him his wife <em>Me-cheet-e-neuh</em> (the wounded
    bear’s shoulder, <a href="#i_258"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 259</a>). Both of these have died since
    their portraits were painted. This dignified chief led a delegation of
    fifteen of his people to Washington City, some years since, and there
    commanded great respect for his eloquence, and dignity of deportment.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_260"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 260</a> is the portrait of <em>Chee-me-na-na-quet</em>
    (the great cloud), son of the chief—an ill-natured and insolent
    fellow who has since been killed for some of his murderous deeds.
    <a href="#i_260"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 261</a>, is the portrait of a fine boy, whose name is
    <em>Tcha-kauks-o-ko-maugh</em> (the great chief). This tribe living out
    of the reach of buffaloes, cover themselves with blankets, instead of
    robes, and wear a profusion of beads and wampum, and other trinkets.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_262"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 262</a>, is<em>Coo-coo-coo</em> (the owl), a very aged and
    emaciated chief, whom I painted at Green Bay, in Fort Howard. He had
    been a distinguished man, but now in his dotage, being more than 100
    years old—and a great pet of the surgeon and officers of the post.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_263"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 263</a>, are two Menominee youths at full length, in
    beautiful dresses, whose names I did not get—one with his war-club in
    his hand, and the other blowing on his “courting flute,” which I have
    before described.</p>

  <p>In addition to these I have painted of this tribe, and placed
    in my Collection, the portraits of <em>Ko-man-i-kin-o-shaw</em>
    (the little whale); <em>Sha-wa-no</em> (the South);
    <em>Mash-kee-wet</em> (the thought); <em>Pah-shee-nau-shaw</em> (———);
    <em>Au-nah-quet-o-hau-pay-o</em> (the one sitting in the clouds);
    <em>Auh-ka-na-paw-wah</em> (earth standing); <em>Ko-man-ni-kin</em> (the
    big wave); <em>O-ho-pa-sha</em> (the small whoop); <em>Au-wah-shew-kew</em>
    (the female bear); and <em>Chesh-ko-tong</em> (he who sings the war-song).</p>

  <p>It will be seen by the reader, from the above facts, that I have been
    laying up much curious and valuable record of people and customs in
    these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> regions; and it will be seen at the same time, from the brief
    manner in which I have treated of these semi-civilized tribes, which
    every body can see, and thousands have seen, that my enthusiasm, as
    I have before explained, has led me more into minuteness and detail
    amongst those tribes which are living in their unchanged native modes,
    whose customs I have been ambitious to preserve for ages to come,
    before the changes that civilized acquaintance will soon work upon them.</p>

  <p>The materials which I am daily gathering, however, are interesting;
    and I may on a future occasion use them—but in an epistle of this
    kind, there is not room for the incidents of a long voyage, or for a
    minute description of the country and the people in it; so, what I
    have said must suffice for the present. I lingered along the shores
    of this magnificent river then, in my fragile bark, to Prairie du
    Chien—Dubuque—Galena, to Rock Island, and lastly to this place.</p>

  <p>During such a Tour between the almost endless banks, carpeted with
    green, with one of the richest countries in the world, extending back
    in every direction, the mind of a contemplative man is continually
    building for posterity splendid seats, cities, towers and villas, which
    a few years of rolling time will bring about, with new institutions,
    new states, and almost empires; for it would seem that this vast region
    of rich soil and green fields, was almost enough for a world of itself.</p>

  <p>I hauled my canoe out of the water at Dubuque, where I joined my wife
    again in the society of kind and hospitable friends, and found myself
    amply repaid for a couple of weeks’ time spent in the examination
    of the extensive lead mines; walking and creeping through caverns,
    some eighty or one hundred feet below the earth’s surface, decked in
    nature’s pure livery of stalactites and spar—with walls, and sometimes
    ceilings, of glistening massive lead. And I hold yet (and ever shall)
    in my mind, without loss of a fraction of feature or expression, the
    image of one of my companions, and the scene that at one time was about
    him. His name is Jeffries. We were in “Lockwood’s Cave,” my wife and
    another lady were behind, and he advancing before me; <em>his</em> ribs,
    more elastic, than mine, gave him entrance through a crevice, into a
    chamber yet unexplored; he dared the pool, for there was one of icy
    water, and translucent as the air itself. We stood luckless spectators,
    to gaze and envy, while he advanced. The lighted flambeau in his hand
    brought the splendid furniture of this tesselated palace into view;
    the surface of the jostled pool laved his sides as he advanced, and
    the rich stalagmites that grew up from the bottom reflected a golden
    light through the water, while the walls and ceiling were hung with
    stalactites which glittered like diamonds.</p>

  <p>In this wise he stood in silent gaze, in awe and admiration of the
    hidden works of Nature; his figure, as high as the surface of the
    water, was magnified into a giant—and his head and shoulders not unfit
    for a cyclop. In fact, he was a perfect figure of Vulcan. The water in
    which he stood was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>a lake of liquid fire—he held a huge hammer in
    his right hand, and a flaming thunderbolt in his left, which he had
    just forged for Jupiter. There was but one thing wanting, it was the
    “sound of the hammer!” which was soon given in peals upon the beautiful
    pendents of stalactite and spar, which sent back and through the
    cavern, the hollow tones of thunder.</p>

  <p>A visit of a few days to Dubuque will be worth the while of every
    traveller; and for the speculator and man of enterprize, it affords the
    finest field now open in our country. It is a small town of 200 houses,
    built entirely within the last two years, on one of the most delightful
    sites on the river, and in the heart of the richest and most productive
    parts of the mining region; having this advantage over most other
    mining countries, that immediately over the richest (and in fact all)
    of the lead mines; the land on the surface produces the finest corn,
    and all other vegetables that may be put into it. This is certainly the
    richest section of country on the Continent, and those who live a few
    years to witness the result, will be ready to sanction my assertion,
    that it is to be the <em>mint of our country</em>.</p>

  <p>From Dubuque, I descended the river on a steamer, with my bark canoe
    laid on its deck, and my wife was my companion, to Camp Des Moines,
    from whence I am now writing.</p>

  <p>After arriving at this place, which is the wintering post of Colonel
    Kearney, with his three companies of dragoons, I seated my wife and two
    gentlemen of my intimate acquaintance, in my bark canoe, and paddled
    them through the Des Moine’s Rapids, a distance of fourteen miles,
    which we performed in a very short time; and at the foot of the Rapids,
    placed my wife on the steamer for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, in company with friends,
    when I had some weeks to return on my track, and revert back again to
    the wild and romantic life that I occasionally love to lead. I returned
    to Camp Des Moines, and in a few days joined General Street, the Indian
    Agent, in a Tour to Ke-o-kuck’s village of Sacs and Foxes.</p>

  <p>Colonel Kearney gave us a corporal’s command of eight men, with
    horses, &amp;c. for the journey; and we reached the village in two days’
    travel, about sixty miles up the Des Moines. The whole country that we
    passed over was like a garden, wanting only cultivation, being mostly
    prairie, and we found their village beautifully situated on a large
    prairie, on the bank of the Des Moines River. They seemed to be well
    supplied with the necessaries of life, and with some of its luxuries.
    I found Ke-o-kuck to be a chief of fine and portly figure, with a good
    countenance, and great dignity and grace in his manners.</p>

  <p>General Street had some documents from Washington, to read to him,
    which he and his chiefs listened to with great patience; after which he
    placed before us good brandy and good wine, and invited us to drink,
    and to lodge with him; he then called up five of his <em>runners</em>
    or <em>criers</em>, communicated to them in a low, but emphatic tone,
    the substance of the talk from the agent, and of the letters read to
    him, and they started at full gallop— one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> of them proclaiming it
    through his village, and the others sent express to the other villages,
    comprising the whole nation. Ke-o-kuck came in with us, with about
    twenty of his principal men—he brought in all his costly wardrobe, that
    I might select for his portrait such as suited me best; but at once
    named (of his own accord) the one that was purely Indian. In that he
    paraded for several days, and in it I painted him at full length. He is
    a man of a great deal of pride, and makes truly a splendid appearance
    on his black horse. He owns the finest horse in the country, and is
    excessively vain of his appearance when mounted, and arrayed, himself
    and horse, in all their gear and trappings. He expressed a wish to see
    himself represented on horseback, and I painted him in that light. He
    rode and nettled his prancing steed in front of my door, until its
    sides were in a gore of blood. I succeeded to <em>his</em> satisfaction,
    and his vanity is increased, no doubt, by seeing himself immortalized
    in that way. After finishing him, I painted his favourite wife (the
    favoured one of seven), his favourite boy, and eight or ten of his
    principal men and women; after which, he and all his men shook hands
    with me, wishing me well, and leaving, as tokens of regard, the most
    valued article of his dress, and a beautiful string of wampum, which he
    took from his wife’s neck.</p>

  <p>They then departed for their village in good spirits, to prepare for
    their <em>fall hunt</em>.</p>

  <p>Of this interesting interview and its incidents, and of these people,
    I shall soon give the reader a further account, and therefore close my
    note-book for the present. Adieu.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">SAINT LOUIS.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be seen by the heading of this Letter that I am back again to
    “head-quarters,” where I have joined my wife, and being seated down by
    a comfortable fire, am to take a little retrospect of my rambles, from
    the time of my last epistle.</p>

  <p>The return to the society of old friends again, has been delightful,
    and amongst those whom I more than esteem, I have met my kind and
    faithful friend Joe Chadwick, whom I have often mentioned, as my
    companion in distress whilst on that disastrous campaign amongst the
    Camanchees. Joe and I have taken great pleasure in talking over the
    many curious scenes we have passed together, many of which are as yet
    unknown to others than ourselves. We had been separated for nearly two
    years, and during that time I had passed many curious scenes worthy
    of Joe’s knowing, and while he sat down in the chair for a portrait I
    painted of him to send to his mother, on leaving the States, to take
    an appointment from Governor Houston in the Texan army; I related to
    him one or two of my recent <em>incidents</em>, which were as follow, and
    pleased Joe exceedingly;—</p>

  <p>“After I had paddled my bark canoe through the rapids, with my wife and
    others in it, as I mentioned, and had put them on board a steamer for
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, I dragged my canoe up the east shore of the rapids, with a
    line, for a distance of four miles, when I stopped and spent half of
    the day in collecting some very interesting minerals, which I had in
    the bottom of my canoe, and ready to get on the first steamer passing
    up, to take me again to Camp Des Moines, at the head of the rapids.</p>

  <p>“I was sitting on a wild and wooded shore, and waiting, when I at
    length discovered a steamer several miles below me, advancing through
    the rapids, and in the interim I set too and cleaned my fowling piece
    and a noble pair of pistols, which I had carried in a belt at my side,
    through my buffalo and other sports of the West, and having put them
    in fine order and deposited them in the bottom of the canoe before me,
    and taken my paddle in hand, with which my long practice had given me
    unlimited confidence, I put off from the shore to the middle of the
    river, which was there a mile and a halt in width, to meet the steamer,
    which was stemming the opposing torrent, and slowly moving up the
    rapids. I made my signal as I neared the steamer, and desired my old
    friend Captain Rogers, not to stop his engine; feeling full confidence
    that I could, with an <em>Indian touch</em> of the paddle, toss my little
    bark around, and gently grapple to the side of the steamer, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
    loaded down, with her gunnels near to the water’s edge. Oh, that my
    skill had been equal to my imagination, or that I could have had at
    that moment, the balance and the skill of an Indian <em>woman</em>, for
    the sake of my little craft and what was in it! I had <em>brought it
    about</em>, with a master hand, however, but the waves of the rapids and
    the foaming of the waters by her sides were too much for my peaceable
    adhesion, and at the moment of wheeling, to part company with her, a
    line, with a sort of “laso throw,” came from an awkward hand on the
    deck, and falling over my shoulder and around the end of my canoe, with
    a simultaneous “haul” to it, sent me down head foremost to the bottom
    of the river; where I was tumbling along with the rapid current over
    the huge rocks on the bottom, whilst my gun and pistols, which were
    emptied from my capsised boat, were taking their permanent position
    amongst the rocks; and my trunk, containing my notes of travel for
    several years, and many other valuable things, was floating off upon
    the surface. If I had drowned, my death would have been witnessed by at
    least an hundred ladies and gentlemen who were looking on, but I <em>did
    not</em>.—I soon took a peep, by the side of my trunk &amp;c., above the
    water, and for the first time in my life was “collared,” and that by
    my friend Captain Rogers, who undoubtedly saved me from making further
    explorations on the river bottom, by pulling me into the boat, to the
    amusement of all on deck, many of whom were my old acquaintance, and
    not knowing the preliminaries, were as much astounded at my sudden
    appearance, as if I had been disgorged from a whale’s belly. A small
    boat was sent off for my trunk, which was picked up about half a mile
    below and brought on board full of water, and consequently, clothes,
    and sketch-books and everything else entirely wet through. My canoe
    was brought on board, which was several degrees dearer to me now than
    it had been for its long and faithful service; but my gun and pistols
    are there yet, and at the service of the lucky one who may find them.
    I remained on board for several miles, till we were passing a wild and
    romantic rocky shore, on which the sun was shining warm, and I launched
    my little boat into the water, with my trunk in it and put off to the
    shore, where I soon had every paper and a hundred other things spread
    in the sun, and at night in good order for my camp, which was at the
    mouth of a quiet little brook, where I caught some fine bass and fared
    well, till a couple of hours paddling the next morning brought me back
    to Camp Des Moines.”</p>

  <p>Here my friend Joe laughed excessively, but said not a word, as I
    kept on painting—and told him also, that a few days after this, I
    put my little canoe on the deck of a steamer ascending the river,
    and landed at Rock Island, ninety miles above, on some business with
    General Street, the Indian Agent—after which I “put off” in my little
    bark, descending the river alone, to Camp Des Moines, with a fine
    double-barrelled fowling-piece, which I had purchased at the garrison,
    lying in the canoe before me as the means of procuring wild fowl, and
    other food on my passage. “Egad!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> said Joe, “how I should like to have
    been with you!” “Sit still,” said I, “or I shall lose your likeness.”
    So Joe kept his position, and I proceeded.</p>

  <p>“I left Rock Island about eleven o’clock in the morning, and at
    half-past three in a pleasant afternoon, in the cool month of October,
    run my canoe to the shore of <em>Mas-co-tin</em> Island, where I stepped
    out upon its beautiful pebbly beach, with my paddle in my hand, having
    drawn the bow of my canoe, as usual, on to the beach, so as to hold
    it in its place. This beautiful island, so called from a band of the
    Illinois Indians of that name, who once dwelt upon it, is twenty-five
    or thirty miles in length, without habitation on or in sight of it,
    and the whole way one extended and lovely prairie; with high banks
    fronting the river, and extending back a great way, covered with a
    high and luxuriant growth of grass. To the top of this bank I went
    with my paddle in my hand, quite innocently, just to range my eye over
    its surface, and to see what might be seen; when, in a minute or two,
    I turned towards the river, and, to my almost annihilating surprise
    and vexation, I saw my little canoe some twenty or thirty rods from
    the shore, and some distance below me, with its head aiming across
    the river, and steadily gliding along in that direction, where the
    wind was roguishly wafting it! What little swearing I had learned
    in the whole of my dealings with the <em>civilized</em> world, seemed
    then to concentrate in two or three involuntary exclamations, which
    exploded as I was running down the beach, and throwing off my garments
    one after the other, till I was denuded—and dashing through the deep
    and boiling current in pursuit of it, I swam some thirty rods in a
    desperate rage, resolving that this <em>must be</em> my remedy, as there
    was no other mode; but at last found, to my great mortification and
    <em>alarm</em>, that the canoe, having got so far from the shore, was
    more in the wind, and travelling at a speed quite equal to my own;
    so that the only safe alternative was to turn and make for the shore
    with all possible despatch. This I did—and had but just strength to
    bring me where my feet could reach the bottom, and I waded out with
    the appalling conviction, that if I had swam one rod farther into the
    stream, my strength would never have brought me to the shore; for it
    was in the fall of the year, and the water so cold as completely to
    have benumbed me, and paralyzed my limbs. I hastened to pick up my
    clothes, which were dropped at intervals as I had run on the beach, and
    having adjusted them on my shivering limbs, I stepped to the top of the
    bank, and took a deliberate view of my little canoe, which was steadily
    making its way to the other shore—with my gun, with my provisions and
    fire apparatus, and sleeping apparel, all snugly packed in it.</p>

  <p>“The river at that place is near a mile wide; and I watched the
    mischievous thing till it ran quite into a bunch of willows on the
    opposite shore, and out of sight. I walked the shore awhile, alone and
    solitary as a Zealand penguin, when I at last sat down, and in one
    minute passed the following resolves from premises that were before
    me, and too imperative to be evaded or unappreciated ‘I am here on a
    desolate island, with nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> to eat, and destitute of the means of
    procuring anything; and if I pass the night, or half a dozen of them
    here, I shall have neither fire or clothes to make me comfortable;
    and nothing short of <em>having my canoe</em> will answer me at all.’
    For this, the only alternative struck me, and I soon commenced upon
    it. An occasional log or limb of drift wood was seen along the beach
    and under the bank, and these I commenced bringing together from all
    quarters, and some I had to lug half a mile or more, to form a raft
    to float me up and carry me across the river. As there was a great
    scarcity of materials, and I had no hatchet to cut anything; I had to
    use my scanty materials of all lengths and of all sizes and all shapes,
    and at length ventured upon the motley mass, with paddle in hand, and
    carefully shoved it off from the shore, finding it just sufficient to
    float me up. I took a seat in its centre on a bunch of barks which I
    had placed for a seat, and which, when I started, kept me a few inches
    above the water, and consequently dry, whilst my feet were resting on
    the raft, which in most parts was sunk a little below the surface. The
    only alternative was <em>to go</em>, for there was no more timber to be
    found; so I balanced myself in the middle, and by reaching forward with
    my paddle, to a little space between the timbers of my raft, I had a
    small place to dip it, and the only one, in which I could make but a
    feeble stroke—propelling me at a very slow rate <em>across</em>, as I
    was floating rapidly <em>down</em> the current. I sat still and worked
    patiently, however, content with the little gain; and at last reached
    the opposite shore about three miles below the place of my embarkation;
    having passed close by several huge snags, which I was lucky enough
    to escape, without the power of having cleared them except by kind
    accident.</p>

  <p>“My craft was ‘unseaworthy’ when I started, and when I had got to the
    middle of the river, owing to the rotten wood, with which a great part
    of it was made, and which had now become saturated with water, it had
    sunk entirely under the surface, letting me down nearly to the waist,
    in the water. In this critical way I moved slowly along, keeping the
    sticks together under me; and at last, when I reached the shore, some
    of the long and awkward limbs projecting from my raft, having reached
    it before me, and being suddenly resisted by the bank, gave the instant
    signal for its dissolution, and my sudden debarkation, when I gave one
    grand leap in the <em>direction</em> of the bank, yet some yards short
    of it, and into the water, from head to foot; but soon crawled out,
    and wended my way a mile or two up the shore, where I found my canoe
    snugly and safely moored in the willows, where I stepped into it, and
    paddled back to the island, and to the same spot where my misfortunes
    commenced, to enjoy the pleasure of exultations, which were to flow
    from contrasting my present with my former situation.</p>

  <p>“Thus, the Island of Mas-co-tin soon lost its horrors, and I strolled
    two days and encamped two nights upon its silent shores—with prairie
    hens and wild fowl in abundance for my meals. From this lovely ground,
    which shews the peaceful graves of hundreds of red men, who have valued
    it before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> me, I paddled off in my light bark, and said, as I looked
    back, ‘Sleep there in peace, ye brave fellows! until the sacrilegious
    hands of white man, and the unsympathizing ploughshare shall turn thy
    bones from their quiet and beautiful resting-place!’</p>

  <p>“Two or three days of strolling, brought me again to the Camp Des
    Moines, and from thence, with my favourite little bark canoe, placed
    upon the deck of the steamer, I embarked for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, where I arrived
    in good order, and soon found the way to the comfortable quarters from
    whence I am now writing.”</p>

  <p>When I finished telling this story to Joe, his portrait was done, and
    I rejoiced to find that I had given to it all the fire and all the
    <em>game look</em> that had become so familiar and pleasing to me in our
    numerous rambles in the far distant wilds of our former campaigns.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p>When I had landed from the steamer Warrior, at the wharf, I left all
    other considerations to hasten and report myself to my dear wife,
    leaving my little canoe on deck and in the especial charge of the
    Captain, till I should return for it in the afternoon, and remove it
    to safe storage with my other Indian articles, to form an interesting
    part of my Museum. On my return to the steamer it was “<em>missing</em>,”
    and like one that I have named on a former occasion, by some
    <em>medicine</em> operation, for ever severed from my sight, though
    not from my recollections, where it will long remain, and also in a
    likeness which I made of it (<a href="#i_240"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 240</a>, <i>a</i>), just after
    the trick it played me on the shore of the Mascotin Island.</p>

  <p>After I had finished the likeness of my friend Joe, and had told him
    the two stories, I sat down and wrote thus in my note-book, and now
    copy it into my Letter:—</p>

  <p>The West—not the “Far West,” for that is a phantom, travelling on
    its tireless wing: but the <em>West</em>, the simple West—the vast and
    vacant wilds which lie between the trodden haunts of present savage
    and civil life—the great and almost boundless garden-spot of earth!
    This is the theme at present. The “antres vast and deserts idle,” where
    the tomahawk sleeps with the bones of the savage, as yet untouched by
    the trespassing ploughshare—the pictured land of silence, which, in
    its melancholy alternately echoes backward and forward the plaintive
    yells of the vanished red men, and the busy chaunts of the approaching
    pioneers. I speak of the boundless plains of beauty, and Nature’s
    richest livery, where the waters of the “great deep” parted in peace,
    and gracefully passed off without leaving deformity behind them. Over
    whose green, enamelled fields, as boundless and free as the ocean’s
    wave, Nature’s proudest, noblest men have pranced on their wild horses,
    and extended, through a series of ages, their long arms in orisons of
    praise and gratitude to the Great Spirit in the sun, for the freedom
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>happiness of their existence.—The land that was beautiful and
    famed, but had no chronicler to tell—where, while “civilized” was yet
    in embryo, dwelt the valiant and the brave, whose deeds of chivalry and
    honour have passed away like themselves, unembalmed and untold—where
    the plumed war-horse has pranced in time with the shrill sounding
    war-cry, and the eagle calumet as oft sent solemn and mutual pledges
    in fumes to the skies. I speak of the <em>neutral ground</em> (for
    such it may be called), where the smoke of the wigwam is no longer
    seen, but the bleaching bones of the buffaloes, and the graves of the
    savage, tell the story of times and days that are passed—the land of
    stillness, on which the red man now occasionally re-treads in sullen
    contemplation, amid the graves of his fathers, and over which civilized
    man advances, filled with joy and gladness.</p>

  <p>Such is the great valley of the Mississippi and Missouri, over almost
    every part of which I have extended my travels, and of which and of its
    future wealth and improvements, I have had sublime contemplations.</p>

  <p>I have viewed man in the artless and innocent simplicity of nature,
    in the full enjoyment of the luxuries which God had bestowed upon
    him. I have seen him happier than kings or princes <em>can</em> be;
    with his pipe and little ones about him. I have seen him shrinking
    from civilized approach, which came <em>with all its vices</em>, like
    the <em>dead of night</em>, upon him: I have seen raised, too, in that
    <em>darkness, religion’s torch</em>, and seen him gaze and then retreat
    like the frightened deer, that are blinded by the light; I have seen
    him shrinking from the soil and haunts of his boyhood, bursting the
    strongest ties which bound him to the earth, and its pleasures; I have
    seen him set fire to his wigwam, and smooth over the graves of his
    fathers; I have seen him (’tis the only thing that will bring them)
    with tears of grief sliding over his cheeks, clap his hand in silence
    over his mouth, and take the <em>last look</em> over his fair hunting
    grounds, and turn his face in sadness to the setting sun. All this
    I have seen performed in Nature’s silent dignity and grace, which
    forsook him not in the last extremity of misfortune and despair; and
    I have seen as often, the approach of the bustling, busy, talking,
    whistling, hopping, elated and exulting white man, with the first
    dip of the ploughshare, making sacrilegious trespass on the bones of
    the valiant dead. I have seen the <em>skull</em>, the <em>pipe</em>, and
    the <em>tomahawk</em> rise from the ground together, in interrogations
    which the sophistry of the world can never answer. I have seen thus,
    in all its forms and features, the grand and irresistible march of
    civilization. I have seen this splendid Juggernaut rolling on, and
    beheld its sweeping desolation; and held converse with the happy
    thousands, living, as yet, beyond its influence, who have not been
    crushed, nor yet have dreamed of its approach.</p>

  <p>I have stood amidst these unsophisticated people, and contemplated with
    feelings of deepest regret, the certain approach of this overwhelming
    system, which will inevitably march on and prosper, until reluctant
    tears shall have watered every rod of this fair land; and from the
    towering cliffs of the Rocky Mountains, the luckless savage will turn
    back his swollen eye, over the blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> and illimitable hunting grounds
    from whence he has fled, and there contemplate, like Caius Marius on
    the ruins of Carthage, their splendid desolation.</p>

  <p>Such is the vast expanse of country from which Nature’s men are at this
    time rapidly vanishing, giving way to the <em>modern crusade</em> which
    is following the thousand allurements, and stocking with myriads, this
    world of green fields. This splendid area, denominated the “Valley of
    the Mississippi,” embraced between the immutable barriers on either
    side, the Alleghany and Rocky Mountains; with the Gulf of Mexico on
    the South, and the great string of lakes on the North, and the mighty
    Mississippi rolling its turbid waters through it, for the distance of
    four thousand miles, receiving its hundred tributaries, whose banks
    and plateaus are capable of supporting a population of one hundred
    millions, covered almost entirely with the richest soil in the world,
    with lead, iron, and coal, sufficient for its population—with twelve
    thousand miles of river navigation for steamers, within its embrace,
    besides the coast on the South, and the great expanse of lakes on the
    North—with a population of five millions, already sprinkled over its
    nether half, and a greater part of the remainder of it, inviting the
    world to its possession, for one dollar and 25 cents (five shillings)
    per acre!</p>

  <p>I ask, who can contemplate, without amazement, this <em>mighty river
    alone</em>, eternally rolling its boiling waters through the richest
    of soil, for the distance of four thousand miles; over three thousand
    five hundred of which, I have myself been wafted on mighty steamers,
    ensconced within “curtains damasked, and carpets ingrain;” and on its
    upper half, gazed with tireless admiration upon its thousand hills and
    mounds of grass and green, sloping down to the water’s edge, in all
    the grace and beauty of Nature’s loveliest fabrication. On its lower
    half, also, whose rich alluvial shores are studded with stately cotton
    wood and elms, which echo back the deep and hollow cough of the puffing
    steamers. I have contemplated the bed of this vast river, sinking from
    its natural surface; and the alligator driven to its bosom, abandoning
    his native bog and fen, which are drying and growing into beauty and
    loveliness under the hand of the husbandman.</p>

  <p>I have contemplated these boundless forests melting away before the
    fatal axe, until the expanded waters of this vast channel, and its
    countless tributaries, will yield their surplus to the thirsty sunbeam,
    to which their shorn banks will expose them; and I have contemplated,
    also, the never-ending transit of steamers, ploughing up the sand
    and deposit from its bottom, which its turbid waters are eternally
    hurrying on to the ocean, sinking its channel, and thereby raising its
    surrounding alluvions for the temptations and enjoyment of man.</p>

  <p>All this is <em>certain</em>. Man’s increase, and the march of human
    improvements in this New World, are as true and irresistible as the
    laws of nature, and he who could rise from his grave and speak, or
    would speak from the <em>life</em> some half century from this, would
    proclaim my prophecy true and fulfilled. I said above, (and I again
    say it,) that these are subjects for “sublime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> contemplation!” At all
    events they are so to the traveller, who has wandered over and seen
    this vast subject in all its parts, and able to appreciate—who has seen
    the frightened <em>herds</em>, as well as <em>multitudes of human</em>,
    giving way and shrinking from the mountain wave of civilization, which
    is busily rolling on behind them.</p>

  <p>From Maine to Florida on the Atlantic coast, the forefathers of those
    hardy sons who are now stocking this fair land, have, from necessity,
    in a hard and stubborn soil, inured their hands to labour, and their
    habits and taste of life to sobriety and economy, which will ensure
    them success in the new world.</p>

  <p>This rich country which is now alluring the enterprising young men from
    the East, being commensurate with the whole Atlantic States, holds out
    the extraordinary inducement that every emigrant can enjoy a richer
    soil, and that too in his own native latitude. The sugar planter, the
    rice, cotton, and tobacco growers—corn, rye, and wheat producers, from
    Louisiana to Montreal, have only to turn their faces to the West, and
    there are waiting for them the same atmosphere to breathe, and green
    fields already cleared, and ready for the plough, too tempting to be
    overlooked or neglected.</p>

  <p>As far west as the banks of the Mississippi, the great wave of
    emigration has rolled on, and already in its rear the valley is
    sprinkled with towns and cities, with their thousand spires pointing
    to the skies. For several hundred miles West, also, have the daring
    pioneers ventured their lives and fortunes, with their families,
    testing the means and luxuries of life, which Nature has spread before
    them; in the country where the buried tomahawk is scarce rusted, and
    the war-cry has scarcely died on the winds. Among these people have I
    roamed. On the Red River I have seen the rich Louisianian chequering
    out his cotton and sugar plantations, where the sunbeam could be seen
    reflected from the glistening pates of his hundred negroes, making
    first trespass with the hoe. I have sat with him at his hospitable
    table in his log cabin, sipping sherry and champaigne. <em>He</em> talks
    of “<em>hogsheads</em> and <em>price of stocks</em>,” or “goes in for
    cotton.”</p>

  <p>In the western parts of Arkansas and Missouri, I have shared the
    genuine cottage hospitality of the abrupt, yet polite and honourable
    Kentuckian; the easy, affable and sociable Tennesseean; <em>this</em>
    has “a smart chance of corn;” the <em>other</em>, perhaps, “a power
    of cotton;” and then, occasionally, (from the “Old Dominion,”) “I
    <em>reckon</em> I shall have a <em>mighty heap</em> of tobacco this
    season,” &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Boys in this country are “<em>peart</em>,” fever and ague renders one
    “<em>powerful weak</em>,” and sometimes it is almost impossible to get
    “<em>shet</em>” of it. Intelligence, hospitality, and good cheer reign
    under all of these humble roofs, and the traveller who knows how to
    appreciate those things, with a good cup of coffee, “<em>corn</em><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
    bread,” and fresh butter, can easily enjoy moments of bliss in converse
    with the humble pioneer.</p>

  <p>On the Upper Mississippi and Missouri, for the distance of seven or
    eight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>hundred miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, is one of the most beautiful
    champaigne countries in the world, continually alternating into timber
    and fields of the softest green, calculated, from its latitude, for the
    people of the northern and eastern states, and “Jonathan” is already
    here—and almost every body else from “down East”—with fences of white,
    drawn and drawing, like chalk lines, over the green prairie. “By gosh,
    this ere is the biggest clearin I ever see.” “I expect we had’nt ought
    to raise nothin but wheat and rye here.”—“I guess you’ve come arter
    land, ha’nt you?”</p>

  <p>Such is the character of this vast country, and such the manner in
    which it is filled up, with people from all parts, tracing their
    own latitudes, and carrying with them their local peculiarities and
    prejudices. The mighty Mississippi, however, the great and everlasting
    highway on which these people are for ever to intermingle their
    interests and manners, will effectually soften down those prejudices,
    and eventually result in an amalgamation of feelings and customs,
    from which this huge mass of population will take one new and general
    appellation.</p>

  <p>It is here that the true character of the <em>American</em> is to be
    formed—here where the peculiarities and incongruities which detract
    from his true character are surrendered for the free, yet lofty
    principle that strikes between meanness and prodigality—between
    <em>literal democracy</em> and <em>aristocracy</em>—between low cunning
    and self-engendered ingenuousness. Such will be found to be the true
    character of the Americans when jostled awhile together, until their
    local angles are worn off; and such may be found and already pretty
    well formed, in the genuine Kentuckian, the first brave and daring
    pioneer of the great West; he is the true model of an American—the
    nucleus around which the character must form, and from which it is
    to emanate to the world. This is the man who first relinquished the
    foibles and fashions of Eastern life, trailing his rifle into the
    forest of the Mississippi, taking simple Nature for his guide. From
    necessity (as well as by nature), bold and intrepid, with the fixed
    and unfaltering brow of integrity, and a hand whose very grip (without
    words) tells you welcome.</p>

  <p>And yet, many people of the East object to the Mississippi, “that it
    is too far off—is out of the world.” But how strange and insufficient
    is such an objection to the traveller who has seen and enjoyed its
    hospitality, and reluctantly retreats from it with feelings of regret;
    pronouncing it a “world of itself, equal in luxuries and amusements to
    any other.” How weak is such an objection to him who has ascended the
    Upper Mississippi to the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, traversed the States of
    Missouri, Illinois, and Michigan, and territory of Ouisconsin; over
    all of which nature has spread her green fields, smiling and tempting
    man to ornament with painted house and fence, with prancing steed and
    tasseled carriage—with countless villages, silvered spires and domes,
    denoting march of intellect and wealth’s refinement. The sun is sure to
    look upon these scenes, and we, perhaps, “<em>may hear the tinkling from
    our graves</em>.” Adieu.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader who would follow me from the place where my last epistle
    was written, to where I now am, must needs start, as I did, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Louis, and cross the Alleghany mountains, to my own native state;
    where I left my wife with my parents, and wended my way to Buffalo, on
    Lake Erie, where I deposited my Collection; and from thence trace, as
    I did, the zig-zag course of the Lakes, from Buffalo to Detroit—to the
    Sault de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marys—to Mackinaw—to Green Bay, and thence the tortuous
    windings of the Fox and Ouisconsin Rivers, to Prairie du Chien; and
    then the mighty Mississippi (for the second time), to the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Anthony—then the sluggish, yet decorated and beautiful <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters,
    towards its source; and thence again (on horseback) the gradually and
    gracefully rising terraces of the shorn, yet green and carpeted plains,
    denominated the “<em>Côteau des Prairies</em>” (being the high and
    dividing ridge between the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters and the Missouri Rivers), where
    I am bivouacked, at the “<em>Red Pipe Stone Quarry</em>.” The distance
    of such a Tour would take the reader 4,000 miles; but I save him the
    trouble by bringing him, in a moment, on the spot.</p>

  <p>This journey has afforded me the opportunity of seeing, on my
    way, <em>Mackinaw</em>—the <em>Sault de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marys</em>, and <em>Green
    Bay</em>—points which I had not before visited; and also of seeing many
    distinguished Indians among the Chippeways, Menomonies and Winnebagoes,
    whom I had not before painted or seen.</p>

  <p>I can put the people of the East at rest, as to the hostile aspect of
    this part of the country, as I have just passed through the midst of
    these tribes, as well as of the Sioux, in whose country I now am, and
    can, without contradiction, assert, that, as far as can be known, they
    are generally well-disposed, and have been so, towards the whites.</p>

  <p>There have been two companies of United States dragoons, ordered
    and marched to Green Bay, where I saw them; and three companies of
    infantry from Prairie du Chien to Fort Winnebago, in anticipation
    of difficulties; but in all probability, without any real cause or
    necessity, for the Winnebago chief answered the officer, who asked him
    if they wanted to fight, “that they <em>could</em> not, had they been so
    disposed; for,” said he, “we have no guns, no ammunition, nor anything
    to eat; and, what is worst of all, one half <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>of our men are dying
    with the small-pox. If you will give us guns and ammunition, and pork,
    and flour, and feed and take care of our squaws and children, we will
    fight you; nevertheless, we will <em>try</em> to fight if you want us to,
    as it is.”</p>

  <p>There is, to appearance (and there is no doubt of the truth of it),
    the most humble poverty and absolute necessity for peace among these
    people at present, that can possibly be imagined. And, amidst their
    poverty and wretchedness, the only war that suggests itself to the eye
    of the traveller through their country, is the <em>war of sympathy and
      pity</em>, which wages in the breast of a feeling, thinking man.</p>

  <p>The small-pox, whose ravages have now pretty nearly subsided, has taken
    off a great many of the Winnebagoes and Sioux. The famous Wa-be-sha,
    of the Sioux, and more than half of his band, have fallen victims
    to it within a few weeks, and the remainder of them, blackened with
    its frightful distortions, look as it they had just emerged from the
    sulphurous regions below. At Prairie du Chien, a considerable number
    of the half-breeds, and French also, suffered death by this baneful
    disease; and at that place I learned one fact, which may be of service
    to science, which was this: that in all cases of vaccination, which had
    been given several years ago, it was an efficient protection; but in
    those cases where the vaccine had been recent (and there were many of
    them), it had not the effect to protect, and in almost every instance
    of such, death ensued.</p>

  <p>At the Sault de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marys on Lake Superior, I saw a considerable number
    of Chippeways, living entirely on fish, which they catch with great
    ease at that place.</p>

  <p>I need not detain the reader a moment with a description of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marys,
    or of the inimitable summer’s paradise, which can always be seen
    at Mackinaw; and which, like the other, has been an hundred times
    described. I shall probably have the chance of seeing about 3,000
    Chippeways at the latter place on my return home, who are to receive
    their annuities at that time through the hands of Mr. Schoolcraft,
    their agent.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_264"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 264</a>, I have given a distant view of <em>Mackinaw</em>,
    as seen approaching it from the East; and in <a href="#i_265"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 265</a>, a view
    of the <em>Sault de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marys</em>, taken from the Canada shore, near the
    missionary-house, which is seen in the foreground of the picture, and
    in distance, the United States Garrison, and the Rapids; and beyond
    them the Capes at the outlet of Lake Superior.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that the Chippeways living in the vicinity of the Sault,
    live entirely on fish; and it is almost literally true also, that the
    French and English, and Americans, who reside about there live on
    fish, which are caught in the greatest abundance in the rapids at that
    place, and are, perhaps, one of the greatest luxuries of the world. The
    <em>white fish</em>, which is in appearance much like a salmon, though
    smaller, is the luxury I am speaking of, and is caught in immense
    quantities by the scoop-nets of the Indians and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> Frenchmen, amongst
    the foaming and dashing water of the rapids (<a href="#i_266"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 266</a>),
    where it gains strength and flavour not to be found in the same fish
    in any other place. This unequalled fishery has long been one of vast
    importance to the immense numbers of Indians, who have always assembled
    about it; but of late, has been found by <em>money-making men</em>, to
    be too valuable a spot for the exclusive occupancy of the savage, like
    hundreds of others, and has at last been filled up with adventurers,
    who have dipped <em>their</em> nets till the poor Indian is styled an
    intruder; and his timid bark is seen dodging about in the coves for
    a scanty subsistence, whilst he scans and envies insatiable white
    man filling his barrels and boats, and sending them to market to be
    converted into money.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_267"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 267</a> is seen one of their favourite amusements at this
    place, which I was lucky enough to witness a few miles below the Sault,
    when high bettings had been made, and a great concourse of Indians had
    assembled to witness an <em>Indian regatta</em> or <em>canoe race</em>,
    which went off with great excitement, firing of guns, yelping, &amp;c. The
    Indians in this vicinity are all Chippeways, and their canoes all made
    of birch bark, and chiefly of one model; they are exceedingly light, as
    I have before described, and propelled with wonderful velocity.</p>

  <p>Whilst I stopped at the Sault, I made excursions on Lake Superior,
    and through other parts of the country, both on the Canada
    and United States sides, and painted a number of Chippeways;
    amongst whom were <em>On-daig</em> (the crow, <a href="#i_268"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 268</a>),
    a young man of distinction, in an extravagant and beautiful
    costume; and <em>Gitch-ee-gaw-ga-osh</em> (the point that remains
    for ever), <a href="#i_268"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 269</a>, an old and respected chief.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
    And besides these, <em>Gaw-zaw-que-dung</em> (he who hallows);
    <em>Kay-ee-qua-da-kum-ee-gish-kum</em> (he who tries the ground with his
    foot); and <em>I-an-be-wa-dick</em> (the male carabou.)</p>

  <p>From Mackinaw I proceeded to Green Bay, which is a flourishing
    beginning of a town, in the heart of a rich country, and the
    head-quarters of land speculators.</p>

  <p>From thence, I embarked in a large bark canoe, with five French
    voyageurs at the oars, where happened to be grouped and <em>messed</em>
    together, five “jolly companions” of us, bound for Fort Winnebago and
    the Mississippi. All our stores and culinary articles were catered for
    by, and bill rendered to, mine host, Mr. C. Jennings (quondam of the
    city hotel in New York), who was one of our party, and whom we soon
    elected “<em>Major</em>” of the expedition; and shortly after, promoted
    to “<em>Colonel</em>”—from the philosophical dignity and patience with
    which he met the difficulties and exposure which we had to encounter,
    as well as for his extraordinary skill and taste displayed in the
    culinary art. Mr. Irving, a relative of W. Irving, Esq., and Mr. Robert
    Serril Wood, an Englishman (both travellers of European realms, with
    fund inexhaustible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>for amusement and entertainment); Lieutenant
    Reed, of the army, and myself, forming the rest of the party. The many
    amusing little incidents which enlivened our transit up the sinuous
    windings of the Fox river, amid its rapids, its banks of loveliest
    prairies and “oak openings,” and its boundless shores of wild rice,
    with the thrilling notes of Mr. Wood’s guitar, and “<i lang="fr">chansons pour
    rire</i>,” from our tawny boatmen, &amp;c. were too good to be thrown away,
    and have been registered, perhaps for a future occasion. Suffice it
    for the present, that our fragile bark brought us in good time to Fort
    Winnebago, with impressions engraven on our hearts which can never
    be erased, of this sweet and beautiful little river, and of the fun
    and fellowship which kept us awake during the nights, almost as well
    as during the days. At this post, after remaining a day, our other
    companions took a different route, leaving Mr. Wood and myself to cater
    anew, and to buy a light bark canoe for our voyage down the Ouisconsin,
    to Prairie du Chien; in which we embarked the next day, with paddles in
    hand, and hearts as light as the zephyrs, amid which we propelled our
    little canoe. Three days’ paddling, embracing two nights’ encampment,
    brought us to the end of our voyage. We entered the mighty Mississippi,
    and mutually acknowledged ourselves paid for our labours, by the
    inimitable scenes of beauty and romance, through which we had passed,
    and on which our untiring eyes had been riveted during the whole way.</p>

  <p>The Ouisconsin, which the French most appropriately denominate “La
    belle riviere,” may certainly vie with any other on the Continent or
    in the world, for its beautifully skirted banks and prairie bluffs. It
    may justly be said to be equal to the Mississippi about the Prairie du
    Chien in point of sweetness and beauty, but not on quite so grand a
    scale.</p>

  <p>My excellent and esteemed fellow-traveller, like a true Englishman, has
    untiringly stuck by me through all difficulties, passing the countries
    above-mentioned, and also the Upper Mississippi, the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, and
    the overland route to our present encampment on this splendid plateau
    of the Western world. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * </span> Thus far have I strolled, within
    the space of a few weeks, for the purpose of reaching <em>classic
    ground</em>.</p>

  <p>Be not amazed if I have sought, in this distant realm, the Indian
    <em>Muse</em>, for here she dwells, and here she must be invoked—nor be
    offended if my narratives from this moment should savour of poetry or
    appear like romance.</p>

  <p>If I can catch the inspiration, I may sing (or yell) a few epistles
    from this famed ground before I leave it; or at least I will
    <em>prose</em> a few of its leading characteristics and mysterious
    legends. This place is great (not in history, for there is none of it,
    but) in traditions, and stories, of which this Western world is full
    and rich.</p>

  <p>“Here (according to their traditions), happened the mysterious birth
    of the red pipe, which has blown its fumes of peace and war to the
    remotest corners of the Continent; which has visited every warrior,
    and passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> its reddened stem the irrevocable oath of war and
    desolation. And here also, the peace-breathing calumet was born, and
    fringed with the eagle’s quills, which has shed its thrilling fumes
    over the land, and soothed the fury of the relentless savage.</p>

  <p>“The Great Spirit at an ancient period, here called the Indian nations
    together, and standing on the precipice of the red pipe stone rock,
    broke from its wall a piece, and made a huge pipe by turning it in his
    hand, which he smoked over them, and to the North, the South, the East,
    and the West, and told them that this stone was red—that it was their
    flesh—that they must use it for their pipes of peace—that it belonged
    to them all, and that the war-club and scalping knife must not be
    raised on its ground. At the last whiff of his pipe his head went into
    a great cloud, and the whole surface of the rock for several miles was
    melted and glazed; two great ovens were opened beneath, and two women
    (guardian spirits of the place), entered them in a blaze of fire; and
    they are heard there yet (Tso-mec-cos-tee, and Tso-me-cos-te-won-dee),
    answering to the invocations of the high priests or medicine-men, who
    consult them when they are visitors to this sacred place.”</p>

  <p>Near this spot, also, on a high mound, is the “<em>Thunder’s nest</em>,”
    (<i lang="fr">nid-du-Tonnere</i>), where “a very small bird sits upon her eggs
    during fair weather, and the skies are rent with bolts of thunder at
    the approach of a storm, which is occasioned by the hatching of her
    brood!”</p>

  <p>“This bird is eternal, and incapable of reproducing her own species:
    she has often been seen by the medicine-men, and is about as large as
    the end of the little finger! Her mate is a serpent, whose fiery tongue
    destroys the young ones as they are hatched, and the fiery noise darts
    through the skies.”</p>

  <p>Such are a few of the stories of this famed land, which of itself, in
    its beauty and loveliness, without the aid of traditionary fame, would
    be appropriately denominated a paradise. Whether it has been an Indian
    Eden or not, or whether the thunderbolts of Indian Jupiter are actually
    forged here, it is nevertheless a place renowned in Indian heraldry
    and tradition, which I hope I may be able to fathom and chronicle, as
    explanatory of many of my anecdotes and traditionary superstitions of
    Indian history, which I have given, and <em>am giving</em>, to the world.</p>

  <p>With my excellent companion, I am encamped on, and writing from, the
    very rock where “the Great Spirit stood when he consecrated the <em>pipe
    of peace</em>, by moulding it from the rock, and smoking it over the
    congregated nations that were assembled about him.” (See <a href="#i_270"><span class="smcap">plate</span>
    270</a>.)</p>

  <p>Lifted up on this stately mound, whose top is fanned with air as
    light to breathe as nitrous oxide gas—and bivouacked on its very
    ridge, (where nought on earth is seen in distance save the thousand
    <em>treeless</em>, <em>bushless</em>, <em>weedless</em> hills of grass and
    vivid green which all around me vanish into an infinity of blue and
    azure), stretched on our bears’-skins, my fellow-traveller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> Mr. Wood,
    and myself, have laid and contemplated the splendid orrery of the
    heavens. With <em>sad delight</em>, that shook me with a terror, have I
    watched the swollen sun <em>shoving down</em> (too fast for time) upon
    the mystic horizon; whose line was lost except as it was marked in blue
    across his blood-red disk. Thus have we laid night after night (two
    congenial spirits who could draw pleasure from sublime contemplation),
    and descanted on our own insignificance; we have closely drawn our
    buffalo robes about us, talked of the ills of life—of friends we had
    lost—of projects that had failed—and of the painful steps we had to
    retrace to reach our own dear native lands again. We have sighed in
    the melancholy of twilight, when the busy winds were breathing their
    last, the chill of sable night was hovering around us, and nought of
    noise was heard but the silvery tones of the howling wolf, and the
    subterraneous whistle of the busy gophirs that were ploughing and
    vaulting the earth beneath us. Thus have we seen <em>wheeled down</em>
    in the <em>West</em>, the glories of day; and at the next moment, in the
    East, beheld her <em>silver majesty</em> jutting up above the horizon,
    with splendour in her face that seemed again to fill the world with
    joy and gladness. We have seen here, too, in all its sublimity, the
    blackening thunderstorm—the lightning’s glare, and stood amidst the
    jarring thunderbolts, that tore and broke in awful rage about us, as
    they rolled over the smooth surface, with nought but empty air to vent
    their vengeance on. There is a sublime grandeur in these scenes as they
    are presented here, which must be seen and felt, to be understood.
    There is a majesty in the very ground that we tread upon, that inspires
    with awe and reverence; and he must have the soul of a brute, who could
    gallop his horse for a whole day over swells and terraces of green that
    rise continually a-head, and tantalize (where hills peep over hills,
    and Alps on Alps arise), without feeling his bosom swell with awe and
    admiration, and himself as well as his thoughts, lifted up in sublimity
    when he rises the last terrace, and sweeps his eye over the wide
    spread, blue and pictured infinity that lies around and beneath him.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>Man feels here, and startles at the thrilling sensation, the force of
    <em>illimitable freedom</em>—his body and his mind both seem to have
    entered a new element—the former as free as the very wind it inhales,
    and the other as expanded and infinite as the boundless imagery that
    is spread in distance around him. Such is (and it is feebly told) the
    <em>Côteau du Prairie</em>. The rock on which I sit to write, is the
    summit of a precipice thirty feet high, extending two miles in length
    and much of the way polished, as if a liquid glazing had been poured
    over its surface. Not far from us, in the solid rock, are the deep
    impressed “footsteps of the Great Spirit (in the form of a track of a
    large bird), where he formerly stood when the blood of the buffaloes
    that he was devouring, ran into the rocks and turned them red.” At a
    few yards from us, leaps a beautiful little stream, from the top of the
    precipice, into a deep basin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>below. Here, amid rocks of the loveliest
    hues, but wildest contour, is seen the poor Indian performing ablution;
    and at a little distance beyond, on the plain, at the base of five huge
    granite boulders, he is humbly propitiating the guardian spirits of the
    place, by sacrifices of tobacco, entreating for permission to take away
    a small piece of the red stone for a pipe. Farther along, and over an
    extended plain are seen, like gophir hills, their excavations, ancient
    and recent, and on the surface of the rocks, various marks and their
    sculptured hieroglyphics—their wakons, totems and medicines—subjects
    numerous and interesting for the antiquary or the merely curious.
    Graves, mounds, and ancient fortifications that lie in sight—the
    <em>pyramid</em> or <em>leaping-rock</em>, and its legends; together with
    traditions, novel and numerous, and a description, graphical and
    geological, of this strange place, have all been subjects that have
    passed rapidly through my contemplation, and will be given in future
    epistles.</p>

  <p>On our way to this place, my English companion and myself were arrested
    by a rascally band of the Sioux, and held in <em>durance vile</em>, for
    having dared to approach the sacred <em>fountain of the pipe</em>! While
    we had halted at the trading-hut of “Le Blanc,” at a place called
    <em>Traverse des Sioux</em>, on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river, and about 150
    miles from the Red Pipe, a murky cloud of dark-visaged warriors and
    braves commenced gathering around the house, closing and cramming all
    its avenues, when one began his agitated and insulting harangue to us,
    announcing to us in the preamble, that we were prisoners, and could not
    go ahead. About twenty of them spoke in turn; and we were doomed to sit
    nearly the whole afternoon, without being allowed to speak a word in
    our behalf, until they had all got through. We were compelled to keep
    our seats like culprits, and hold our tongues, till all had brandished
    their fists in our faces, and vented all the threats and invective
    which could flow from Indian malice, grounded on the presumption that
    we had come to trespass on their dearest privilege,—their religion.</p>

  <p>There was some allowance to be made, and some excuse, surely, for the
    rashness of these poor fellows, and we felt disposed to pity, rather
    than resent, though their <em>unpardonable stubbornness</em> excited us
    almost to desperation. Their superstition was sensibly touched, for we
    were persisting, in the most peremptory terms, in the determination
    to visit this, their greatest medicine (mystery) place; where, it
    seems, they had often resolved no white man should ever be allowed to
    go. They took us to be “officers sent by Government to see what this
    place was worth,” &amp;c. As “this red stone was a part of their flesh,”
    it would be sacrilegious for white man to touch or take it away—“a
    hole would be made in their flesh, and the blood could never be made
    to stop running.” My companion and myself were here in a <em>fix</em>,
    one that demanded the use of every energy we had about us; astounded
    at so unexpected a rebuff, and more than ever excited to go ahead,
    and see what was to be seen at this strange place; in this emergency,
    we mutually agreed to go forward, even if it should be at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> the hazard
    of our lives; we heard all they had to say, and then made our own
    speeches—and at length had our horses brought, which we mounted and
    rode off without further molestation; and having arrived upon this
    interesting ground, have found it quite equal in interest and beauty to
    our sanguine expectations, abundantly repaying us for all our trouble
    in traveling to it.</p>

  <p>I had long ago heard many curious descriptions of this spot given by
    the Indians, and had contracted the most impatient desire to visit
    it.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It will be seen by some of the traditions inserted in this
    Letter, from my notes taken on the Upper Missouri four years since,
    that those tribes have visited this place freely in former times; and
    that it has once been held and owned in common, as neutral ground,
    amongst the different tribes who met here to renew their pipes, under
    some superstition which stayed the tomahawk of natural foes, always
    raised in deadly hate and vengeance in other places. It will be
    seen also, that within a few years past (and that, probably, by the
    instigation of the whites, who have told them that by keeping off other
    tribes, and manufacturing the pipes themselves, and trading them to
    other adjoining nations, they can acquire much influence and wealth),
    the Sioux have laid entire claim to this quarry; and as it is in the
    centre of their country, and they are more powerful than any other
    tribes, they are able successfully to prevent any access to it.</p>

  <p>That this place should have been visited for centuries past by all the
    neighbouring tribes, who have hidden the war-club as they approached
    it, and stayed the cruelties of the scalping-knife, under the fear of
    the vengeance of the Great Spirit, who overlooks it, will not seem
    strange or unnatural, when their religion and superstitions are known.</p>

  <p>That such has been the custom, there is not a shadow of doubt; and that
    even so recently as to have been witnessed by hundreds and thousands
    of Indians of different tribes, now living, and from many of whom I
    have personally drawn the information, some of which will be set forth
    in the following traditions; and as an additional (and still more
    conclusive) evidence of the above position, here are to be seen (and
    will continue to be seen for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>ages to come), the <em>totems</em> and
    <em>arms</em> of the different tribes, who have visited this place for
    ages past, deeply engraved on the quartz rocks, where they are to be
    recognized in a moment (and not to be denied) by the passing traveller,
    who has been among these tribes, and acquired even but a partial
    knowledge of them and their respective modes.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

  <p>The thousands of inscriptions and paintings on the rocks at this
    place, as well as the ancient diggings for the pipe-stone, will afford
    amusement for the world who will visit it, without furnishing the least
    data, I should think, of the time at which these excavations commenced,
    or of the period at which the Sioux assumed the exclusive right to it.</p>

  <p>Among the many traditions which I have drawn personally from the
    different tribes, and which go to support the opinion above advanced,
    is the following one, which was related to me by a distinguished
    Knisteneaux, on the Upper Missouri, four years since, on occasion of
    presenting to me a handsome red stone pipe. After telling me that he
    had been to this place—and after describing it in all its features, he
    proceeded to say:—</p>

  <p>“That in the time of a great freshet, which took place many centuries
    ago, and destroyed all the nations of the earth, all the tribes of the
    red men assembled on the Côteau du Prairie, to get out of the way of
    the waters. After they had all gathered here from all parts, the water
    continued to rise, until at length it covered them all in a mass, and
    their flesh was converted into red pipe stone. Therefore it has always
    been considered neutral ground—it belonged to all tribes alike, and all
    were allowed to get it and smoke it together.</p>

  <p>“While they were all drowning in a mass, a young woman, K-wap-tah-w (a
    virgin), caught hold of the foot of a very large bird that was flying
    over, and was carried to the top of a high cliff, not far off, that
    was above the water. Here she had twins, and their father was the
    war-eagle, and her children have since peopled the earth.</p>

  <p>“The pipe stone, which is the flesh of their ancestors, is smoked by
    them as the symbol of peace, and the eagle’s quill decorates the head
    of the brave.”</p>

  <p><em>Tradition of the Sioux.</em>—“Before the creation of man, the Great
    Spirit (whose tracks are yet to be seen on the stones, at the Red Pipe,
    in form of the tracks of a large bird) used to slay the buffaloes and
    eat them on the ledge of the Red Rocks, on the top of the Côteau des
    Prairies, and their blood running on to the rocks, turned them red. One
    day when a large snake had crawled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>into the nest of the bird to eat
    his eggs, one of the eggs hatched out in a clap of thunder, and the
    Great Spirit catching hold of a piece of the pipe stone to throw at the
    snake, moulded it into a man. This man’s feet grew fast in the ground
    where he stood for many ages, like a great tree, and therefore he grew
    very old; he was older than an hundred men at the present day; and at
    last another tree grew up by the side of him, when a large snake ate
    them both off at the roots, and they wandered off together; from these
    have sprung all the people that now inhabit the earth.”</p>

  <p>The above tradition I found amongst the Upper Missouri Sioux, but
    which, when I related to that part of the great tribe of Sioux who
    inhabit the Upper Mississippi, they seemed to know nothing about it.
    The reason for this may have been, perhaps, as is often the case, owing
    to the fraud or excessive ignorance of the interpreter, on whom we
    are often entirely dependent in this country; or it is more probably
    owing to the very vague and numerous fables which may often be found,
    cherished and told by different bands or families in the same tribe,
    and relative to the same event.</p>

  <p>I shall on a future occasion, give you a Letter on traditions of this
    kind, which will be found to be very strange and amusing; establishing
    the fact at the same time, that theories respecting their origin,
    creation of the world, &amp;c. &amp;c., are by no means uniform throughout
    the different tribes, nor even through an individual tribe; and that
    very many of these theories are but the vagaries, or the ingenious
    systems of their medicine or mystery-men, conjured up and taught to
    their own respective parts of a tribe, for the purpose of gaining an
    extraordinary influence over the minds and actions of the remainder
    of the tribe, whose superstitious minds, under the supernatural
    controul and dread of these self-made magicians, are held in a state of
    mysterious vassalage.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Sioux of the Mississippi, and who live in the region of
    the Red Pipe Stone Quarry, I found the following and not less strange
    tradition on the same subject. “Many ages after the red men were made,
    when all the different tribes were at war, the Great Spirit sent
    runners and called them all together at the ‘Red Pipe.’—He stood on the
    top of the rocks, and the red people were assembled in infinite numbers
    on the plains below. He took out of the rock a piece of the red stone,
    and made a large pipe; he smoked it over them all; told them that it
    was part of their flesh; that though they were at war, they must meet
    at this place as friends; that it belonged to them all; that they must
    make their calumets from it and smoke them to him whenever they wished
    to appease him or get his good-will—the smoke from his big pipe rolled
    over them all, and he disappeared in its cloud; at the last whiff
    of his pipe a blaze of fire rolled over the rocks, and melted their
    surface—at that moment two squaws went in a blaze of fire under the two
    medicine rocks, where they remain to this day, and must be consulted
    and propitiated whenever the pipe stone is to be taken away.”</p>

  <p>The following speech of a Mandan, which was made to me in the Mandan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
    village four years since, after I had painted his picture, I have
    copied from my note-book as corroborative of the same facts:</p>

  <p>“My brother—You have made my picture and I like it much. My friends
    tell me they can see the eyes move, and it must be very good—it must
    be partly alive. I am glad it is done—though many of my people are
    afraid. I am a young man, but my heart is strong. I have jumped on to
    the medicine-rock—I have placed my arrow on it and no Mandan can take
    it away.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The red stone is slippery, but my foot was true—it did
    not slip. My brother, this pipe which I give to you, I brought from a
    high mountain, it is toward the rising sun—many were the pipes that
    we brought from there—and we brought them away in peace. We left our
    <em>totems</em> or marks on the rocks—we cut them deep in the stones,
    and they are there now. The Great Spirit told all nations to meet
    there in peace, and all nations hid the war-club and the tomahawk. The
    <em>Dah-co-tahs</em>, who are our enemies, are very strong—they have
    taken up the tomahawk, and the blood of our warriors has run on the
    rocks. My friend, we want to visit our medicines—our pipes are old and
    worn out. My friend, I wish you to speak to our Great Father about
    this.”</p>

  <p>The chief of the Puncahs, on the Upper Missouri, also made the
    following allusion to this place, in a speech which he made to me on
    the occasion of presenting me a very handsome pipe about four years
    since:—</p>

  <p>“My friend, this pipe, which I wish you to accept, was dug from the
    ground, and cut and polished as you now see it, by my hands. I wish
    you to keep it, and when you smoke through it, recollect that this
    red stone is a part of our flesh. This is one of the last things we
    can ever give away. Our enemies the Sioux, have raised the red flag
    of blood over the Pipe Stone Quarry, and our medicines there are
    trodden under foot by them. The Sioux are many, and we cannot go to the
    mountain of the red pipe. We have seen all nations smoking together at
    that place—but, my brother, it is not so now.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

  <p>Such are a few of the stories relating to this curious place, and many
    others might be given which I have procured, though they amount to
    nearly the same thing, with equal contradictions and equal absurdities.</p>

  <p>The position of the Pipe Stone Quarry, is in a direction nearly West
    from the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, at a distance of three hundred miles,
    on the summit of the dividing ridge between the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters and the
    Missouri rivers, being about equi-distant from either. This dividing
    ridge is denominated by the French, the “Côteau des Prairies,” and
    the “Pipe Stone Quarry” is situated near its southern extremity, and
    consequently not exactly on its highest elevation, as its general
    course is north and south, and its southern extremity terminates in a
    gradual slope.</p>

  <p>Our approach to it was from the East, and the ascent, for the distance
    of fifty miles, over a continued succession of slopes and terraces,
    almost imperceptibly rising one above another, that seemed to lift
    us to a great height. The singular character of this majestic mound,
    continues on the West side, in its descent toward the Missouri. There
    is not a tree or bush to be seen from the highest summit of the ridge,
    though the eye may range East and West, almost to a boundless extent,
    over a surface covered with a short grass, that is green at one’s feet,
    and about him, but changing to blue in distance, like nothing but the
    blue and vastness of the ocean.</p>

  <p>The whole surface of this immense tract of country is hard and smooth,
    almost without stone or gravel, and coated with a green turf of grass
    of three or four inches only in height. Over this the wheels of a
    carriage would run as easily, for hundreds of miles, as they could on a
    Mc Adamized road, and its graceful gradations would in all parts, admit
    of a horse to gallop, with ease to himself and his rider.</p>

  <p>The full extent and true character of these vast prairies are but
    imperfectly understood by the world yet; who will agree with me that
    they are a subject truly sublime, for contemplation, when I assure
    them, that “a coach and four” might, be driven with ease, (with the
    exception of rivers and ravines, which are in many places impassable),
    over unceasing fields of green, from the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony to Lord
    Selkirk’s Establishment on the Red <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>River, at the North; from that to
    the mouth of Yellow Stone on the Missouri—thence to the Platte—to the
    Arkansas, and Red Rivers of the South, and through Texas to the Gulf of
    Mexico, a distance of more than three thousand miles.</p>

  <p>I mentioned in a former Letter, that we had been arrested by the Sioux,
    on our approach to this place, at the trading-post of Le Blanc, on
    the banks of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters; and I herein insert the most important
    part of the speeches made, and talks held on that momentous occasion,
    as near as my friend and I could restore them, from partial notes and
    recollection. After these copper-visaged advocates of their country’s
    rights had assembled about us, and filled up every avenue of the cabin,
    the grave council was opened in the following manner:—</p>

  <p><em>Te-o-kun-hko</em> (the swift man), first rose and said—</p>

  <p>“My friends, I am not a chief, but the son of a chief—I am the son of
    my father—he is a chief—and when he is gone away, it is my duty to
    speak for him—he is not here—but what I say is the talk of his mouth.
    We have been told that you are going to the Pipe Stone Quarry. We come
    now to ask for what purpose you are going, and what business you have
    to go there.” (‘How! how!’ vociferated all of them, thereby approving
    what was said, giving assent by the word <em>how</em>, which is their
    word for yes).</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—I am a brave, but not a chief—my arrow stands in
    the top of the leaping-rock; all can see it, and all know that
    Te-o-kun-hko’s foot has been there. (‘How! how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—We look at you and we see that you are Che-mo-ke-mon
    capitains (white men officers): we know that you have been sent by your
    Government, to see what that place is worth, and we think the white
    people want to buy it. (‘How! how!’).</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—We have seen always that the white people, when they
    see anything in our country that they want, send officers to value it,
    and then if they can’t buy it, they will get it some other way. (‘How!
    how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—I speak strong, my heart is strong, and I speak fast;
    this red pipe was given to the red men by the Great Spirit—it is a part
    of our flesh, and therefore is great <em>medicine</em>. (‘How! how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—We know that the whites are like a great cloud that
    rises in the East, and will cover the whole country. We know that they
    will have all our lands; but, if ever they get our Red Pipe Quarry they
    will have to pay very dear for it. (‘How! how! how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—We know that no white man has ever been to the Pipe
    Stone Quarry, and our chiefs have often decided in council that no
    white man shall ever go to it. (‘How! how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—You have heard what I have to say, and you can go no
    further, but you must turn about and go back. (‘How! how! how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>—You see that the sweat runs from my face, for I am
    troubled.”</p>

  <p>Then I commenced to reply in the following manner:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

  <p>“My friends, I am sorry that you have mistaken us so much, and the
    object of our visit to your country. We are not officers—we are not
    sent by any one—we are two poor men travelling to see the Sioux and
    shake hands with them, and examine what is curious or interesting
    in their country. This man who is with me is my friend; he is a
    <em>Sa-ga-nosh</em> (an Englishman).</p>

  <p>(‘How! how! how!’)</p>

  <p>(All rising and shaking hands with him, and a number of them taking out
    and showing British medals which were carried in their bosoms.)</p>

  <p>“We have heard that the Red Pipe Quarry was a great curiosity, and we
    have started to go to it, and we will not be stopped.” (Here I was
    interrupted by a grim and black-visaged fellow, who shook his long
    shaggy locks as he rose, with his sunken eyes fixed in direst hatred on
    me, and his fist brandished within an inch of my face.)</p>

  <p>“<em>Pale faces!</em> you cannot speak till we have all done; you are our
    <em>prisoners</em>—our young men (our soldiers) are about the house, and
    you must listen to what we have to say. What has been said to you is
    true, you must go back. (‘How! how!’)</p>

  <p>“We heard the word <em>Saganosh</em>, and it makes our hearts glad; we
    shook hand with our brother—his father is our father—he is our Great
    Father—he lives across the big lake—his son is here, and we are glad—we
    wear our Great Father the sag-a-nosh on our bosoms, and we keep his
    face bright<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>—we shake hands, but no white man has been to the red
    pipe and none shall go. (‘How!’)</p>

  <p>“You see (holding a red pipe to the side of his naked arm) that this
    pipe is a part of our flesh. The red men are a part of the red stone.
    (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“If the white men take away a piece of the red pipe stone, it is a hole
    made in our flesh, and the blood will always run. We cannot stop the
    blood from running. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“The Great Spirit has told us that the red stone is only to be used for
    pipes, and through them we are to smoke to him. (‘How!’)</p>

  <p>“Why do the white men want to get there? You have no good object in
    view; we know you have none, and the sooner you go back, the better.”
    (“How, how!”)</p>

  <p><em>Muz-za</em> (the iron) spoke next.</p>

  <p>“My friends, we do not wish to harm you; you have heard the words of
    our chief men, and you now see that you must go back. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Tchan-dee-pah-sha-kah-free</em> (the red pipe stone) was given to
    us by the Great Spirit, and no one need ask the price of it, for it is
    <em>medicine</em>. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“My friends, I believe what you have told us; I think your intentions
    are good; but our chiefs have always told us, that no white man was
    allowed to go there—and you cannot go.” (“How, how!”)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

  <p><em>Another.</em>—“My friends, you see I am a young man; you see on my
    war-club two scalps from my enemies’ heads; my hands have been dipped
    in blood, but I am a good man. I am a friend to the whites, to the
    traders; and they are your friends. I bring them 3000 muskrat skins
    every year, which I catch in my own traps. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“We love to go to the Pipe Stone, and get a piece for our pipes; but we
    ask the Great Spirit first. If the white men go to it, they will take
    it out, and not fill up the holes again, and the Great Spirit will be
    offended.” (“How, how, how!”)</p>

  <p><em>Another.</em>—“My friends, listen to me! what I am to say will be the
    truth.—(‘How!’)</p>

  <p>“I brought a large piece of the pipe stone, and gave it to a white man
    to make a pipe; he was our trader, and I wished him to have a good
    pipe. The next time I went to his store, I was unhappy when I saw that
    stone made into a dish! (‘Eugh!’)</p>

  <p>“This is the way the white men would use the red pipe stone, if they
    could get it. Such conduct would offend the Great Spirit, and make a
    red man’s heart sick. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“<em>Brothers</em>, we do not wish to harm you—if you turn about and go
    back, you will be well, both you and your <em>horses</em>—you cannot go
    forward. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“We know that if you go to the pipe stone, the Great Spirit looks upon
    you—the white people do not think of that. (‘How, how!’)</p>

  <p>“I have no more to say.”</p>

  <p>These, and a dozen other speeches to the same effect, having been
    pronounced, I replied in the following manner:</p>

  <p>“<em>My friends</em>, you have entirely mistaken us; we are no officers,
    nor are we sent by any one—the white men do not want the red pipe—it
    is not worth their carrying home so far, if you were to give it all to
    them. Another thing, they don’t use pipes—they don’t know how to smoke
    them.</p>

  <p>‘How, how!’</p>

  <p>“<em>My friends</em>, I think as you do, that the Great Spirit has given
    that place to the red men for their pipes.</p>

  <p>‘How, how, how!’</p>

  <p>“I give you great credit for the course you are taking to preserve and
    protect it; and I will do as much as any man to keep white men from
    taking it away from you.</p>

  <p>‘How, how!’</p>

  <p>“But we have started to go and see it; and we cannot think of being
    stopped.”</p>

  <p>Another rose (interrupting me):—</p>

  <p>“White men! your words are very smooth; you have some object in view or
    you would not be so determined to go—you have no good design, and the
    quicker you turn back the better; there is no use of talking any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> more
    about it—if you think best to go, try it; that’s all I have to say.”
    (“How, how!”)</p>

  <p>During this scene, the son of Monsr. Le Blanc was standing by, and
    seeing this man threatening me so hard by putting his fist near my
    face; he several times stepped up to him, and told him to stand back
    at a respectful distance, or that he would knock him down. After their
    speaking was done, I made a few remarks, stating that we should go
    ahead, which we did the next morning, by saddling our horses and riding
    off through the midst of them, as I have before described.</p>

  <p>Le Blanc told us, that these were the most disorderly and treacherous
    part of the Sioux nation, that they had repeatedly threatened his life,
    and that he expected they would take it. He advised us to go back as
    they ordered; but we heeded not his advice.</p>

  <p>On our way we were notified at several of their villages which
    we passed, that we must go back; but we proceeded on, and over a
    beautiful prairie country, of one hundred miles or more, when our
    Indian guide brought us to the trading-house of an old acquaintance of
    mine, Monsieur La Fromboise, who lives very comfortably, and in the
    employment of the American Fur Company, near the base of the Côteau,
    and forty or fifty miles from the Pipe Stone Quarry.</p>

  <p>We rode up unexpectedly, and at full gallop, to his door, when he met
    us and addressed us as follows:—</p>

  <p>“Ha! Monsr. how do you do?—Quoi! ha, est ce vous, Monsr. Cataline—est
    il possible? Oui, oui, vraiment le meme—mon ami, Cataline—comment se
    va-t-il? et combien (pardon me though, for I can speak English). How
    have you been since I saw you last season? and how under Heaven, have
    you wandered into this wild region, so far from civilization? Dismount,
    dismount, gentlemen, and you are welcome to the comforts, such as they
    are, of my little cabin.”</p>

  <p>“Monsr. La Fromboise, allow me to introduce to your acquaintance, my
    friend, and travelling companion, Mr. Wood, of England.”</p>

  <p>“Monsr. Wood, I am happy to see you, and I hope you will make allowance
    for the rudeness of my cabin, and the humble manner in which I shall
    entertain you.”</p>

  <p>“I assure you, my dear sir, that no apology is necessary; for your
    house looks as delightful as a palace, to Mr. Catlin and myself, who
    have so long been tenants of the open air.”</p>

  <p>“Gentlemen, walk in; we are surrounded with red folks here, and you
    will be looked upon by them with great surprise.”</p>

  <p>“That’s what we want to see exactly. Catlin! that’s fine—oh! how lucky
    we are.”</p>

  <p>“Well, gentlemen, walk into the other room; you see I have two rooms
    to my house (or rather cabin), but they are small and unhandy. Such as
    I have shall be at your service heartily; and I assure you, gentlemen,
    that this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> happiest moment of my life. I cannot give you
    feather-beds to sleep on; but I have a plenty of new robes, and you,
    at all events, Monsr. Cataline, know by this time how to make a bed of
    them. We can give you plenty of buffalo meat, buffalo tongues, wild
    geese, ducks, prairie hens, venison, trout, young swan, beaver tails,
    pigeons, plums, grapes, young bear, some green corn, squash, onions,
    water-melons, and pommes des terres, some coffee and some tea.”</p>

  <p>“My good friend, one-half or one-third of these things (which are all
    luxuries to us) would render us happy; put yourself to no trouble on
    our account, and we shall be perfectly happy under your roof.”</p>

  <p>“I am very sorry, gentlemen, that I cannot treat you as I would be
    glad to do; but you must make up for these things if you are fond of
    sporting, for there are plenty of buffaloes about; at a little distance
    the prairies are speckled with them; and our prairies and lakes abound
    with myriads of prairie hens, ducks, geese and swan. You shall make me
    a long visit, gentlemen, and we will have sport in abundance. I assure
    you, that I shall be perfectly happy whilst you are with me. Pardon me
    a little, while I order you some dinner, and attend to some Indians who
    are in my store, trading, and taking their fall credits.”</p>

  <p>“That’s a fine fellow I’ll engage you,” said my companion.</p>

  <p>“Yes, he is all that. I have known him before; he is a gentleman, and
    a polished one too, every ounce of him. You see in this instance how
    durable and lasting are the manners of a true gentleman, and how little
    a life-time of immersion in the wilderness, amid the reckless customs
    of savage life, will extinguish or efface them. I could name you a
    number of such, whose surface seems covered with a dross, which once
    rubbed of, shows a polish brighter than ever.”</p>

  <p>We spent a day or two very pleasantly with this fine and hospitable
    fellow, until we had rested from the fatigue of our journey; when he
    very kindly joined us with fresh horses, and piloted us to the Pipe
    Stone Quarry, where he is now encamped with us, a jolly companionable
    man, and familiar with most of the events and traditions of this
    strange place, which he has visited on former occasions.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>La Fromboise has some good Indian blood in his veins, and from his
    modes of life, as well as from a natural passion that seems to belong
    to the French adventurers in these wild regions, he has a great relish
    for songs and stories, of which he gives us many, and much pleasure;
    and furnishes us one of the most amusing and gentlemanly companions
    that could possibly be found. My friend Wood sings delightfully,
    also, and as I cannot sing, but can tell, now and then, a story, with
    tolerable effect, we manage to pass away <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>our evenings, in our humble
    bivouack, over our buffalo meat and prairie hens, with much fun and
    amusement. In these nocturnal amusements, I have done <em>my</em> part,
    by relating anecdotes of my travels on the Missouri, and other parts
    of the Indian country which I have been over; and occasionally reading
    from my note-book some of the amusing entries I had formerly made in
    it, but never have had time to transcribe for the world.</p>

  <p>As I can’t write music, and <em>can</em> (in my own way) write a story,
    the readers will acquit me of egotism or partiality, in reporting only
    <em>my own part</em> of the entertainments; which was generally the mere
    reading a story or two from my notes which I have with me, or relating
    some of the incidents of life which my old travelling companion
    “<em>Batiste</em>” and I had witnessed in former years.</p>

  <p>Of these, I read one last evening, that pleased my good friend La
    Fromboise so exceedingly, that I am constrained to copy it into my
    Letter and send it home.</p>

  <p>This amusing story is one that my man Ba’tiste used to tell to Bogard,
    and others with great zest; describing his adventure one night, in
    endeavouring to procure a <em>medicine-bag</em>, which I had employed him
    to obtain for me on the Upper Missouri; and he used to prelude it thus:—</p>

  <p>“Je commence—”</p>

  <p>“Dam your commonce, (said Bogard), tell it in English—”</p>

  <p>“Pardón, Monsieur, en Americaine—”</p>

  <p>“Well, American then, if you please; anything but your darned
    ‘<i lang="fr">parlez vous</i>.’”</p>

  <p>“Bien, excusez—now Monsieur Bogard, you must know first place, de
    ‘<em>Medicine-Bags</em>’ is mere humbug, he is no <em>medicine</em> in
    him—no pills; he is someting mysterieux. Some witchcraft, súppose. You
    must know que tous les sauvages have such tings about him, pour for
    good luck. Ce n’est que (pardón) it is only <em>hocus pocus</em>, to keep
    off witch, súppose. You must know ces articles can nevare be sold, of
    course you see dey cannot be buy. So my friend here, Monsieur Cataline,
    who have collect all de curiosités des pays sauvages, avait made strong
    applique to me pour for to get one of dese <em>medicine-bags</em> for his
    Collection curieux, et I had, pour moimeme, le curiosité extreme pour
    for to see des quelques choses ces étranges looking tings was composi.</p>

  <p>I had learn much of dese strange custom, and I know wen de Ingin die,
    his <em>medicine-bags</em> is buried wis him.</p>

  <p>Oui, Monsieur, so it never can be got by any boday. Bien. I hap to tink
    one day wen we was live in de mous of Yellow Stone, now is time, and I
    avait said to Monsieur Cataline, que pensez vous? <em>Kon-te-wonda</em>
    (un des chefs du) (pardón, one of de chiefs, of de Knisteneaux) has die
    tó-day. Il ayait une <em>medicine-bag</em> magnifique, et extremement
    curieux; il est composé d’un, it is made (pardón, si vous plait) of
    de wite wolf skin, ornement et stuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> wid tousand tings wich we shall
    see, ha? Good luck! Suppose Monsieur Cataline, I have seen him just
    now. I av see de <em>medicine-bag</em>; laid on his breast avec his hands
    crossed ovare it. Que pensez vous? I can get him to-night, ha? If you
    will keep him, if you shall not tell, ha? ’Tis no harm—’tis no steal—he
    is dead, ha? Well, you shall <em>see</em>. But, would you not be afraid,
    Ba’tiste, (said Monsieur Cataline), to take from dis poor fellow his
    medicines (or mysteries) on which he has rest all his hopes in dis
    world, and de world to come? Pardón, je n’ai pas peur; non, Monsieur,
    ne rien de peur. I nevare saw ghost—I have not fear, mais, súppose, it
    is not right, éxact; but I have grand disposition pour for to obligé
    my friend, et le curiosité moimeme, pour to see wat it is made of;
    suppose tó-night I shall go, ha? ‘Well, Ba’tiste, I have no objection
    (said Monsieur Cataline) if your heart does not fail you, for I will
    be very glads to get him, and will make you a handsome present for it,
    but I think it will be a cold and gloomy kind of business.’ Nevare
    mind, Monsieur Cataline (I said) provide he is well dead, <em>perfect
    dead</em>! Well, I had see les Knisteneaux when dey ave bury de chap—I
    ave watch close, and I ave see how de medicine-bags was put. It was
    fix pretty tight by some cord around his bellay, and den some skins
    was wrap many times áround him—he was put down in de hole dug for him,
    and some flat stones and some little dirt was laid on him, only till
    next day, wen some grand ceremonays was to be pérform ovare him, and
    den de hole was to be fill up; now was de only time possibe for de
    <em>medicine-bag</em>, ha? I ave very pretty little wife at dat times,
    Assinneboin squaw, and we sleep in one of de stores inside of de Fort,
    de Trade-house, you know, ha?</p>

  <p>“So you may súppose I was all de day perplex to know how I should go,
    somebody may watch—súppose, he may not be dead! not quite dead, ha?
    nevare mind—le jour was bien long, et le nuit dismal, <em>dismal</em>!
    oh by gar <em>it was dismal</em>! plien, plien (pardon) full of
    apprehension, mais sans <em>peur</em>, je <em>navais pas peur</em>! So
    some time aftere midnights, wen it was bout right time pour go, I made
    start, very light, so my wife must not wake. Oh diable l’imagination!
    quel solitude! well, I have go very well yet, I am pass de door, and I
    am pass de gate, and I am at lengts arrive at de grave! súppose ‘now
    Ba’tiste, courage, courage! now is de times come.’ Well, suppose, I am
    not fraid of <em>dead man</em>, mais, perhaps, dese <em>medicine-bag</em>
    is give by de Grande Esprit to de Ingin for someting? possibe! I will
    let him keep it. I shall go back! No, Monsieur Cataline will laughs at
    me. I must have him, ma foi, mon courage! so I climb down very careful
    into de grave, mais, as I déscend, my heart rise up into my mouse! Oh
    mon Dieu! courage Ba’tiste, courage! ce n’est pas <em>l’homme</em> dat I
    fear, mais le <em>medicine</em>, le <em>medicine</em>. So den I ave lift
    out de large stones, I ave put out my head in de dark, and I ave look
    all de contré round; ne personne, ne personne—no bodé in sight! Well,
    I ave got softly down on my knees ovare him, (oh, courage! courage!
    oui) and wen I ave unwrap de robe, I av all de time say, ‘pardon,
    courage! pardon, courage!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> untill I ad got de skins all off de bodé;
    I ave den take hold of de cord to untie, mais!! (dans l’instant) two
    cold hands seize me by de wrists! and I was just dead—I was petrifact
    in one instant. Oh <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Esprit! I could just see in de dark two eyes
    glaring like fire sur upon me! and den, (oh, eugh!) it spoke to me,
    ‘Who are you?’ (Sacré, vengeance! it will not do to deceive him, no,)
    ‘I am Ba’tiste, <em>poor</em> Ba’tiste!’ ‘Then thou art surely mine, (as
    he clenched both arms tight around my boday) lie still Ba’tiste.’ Oh,
    holy Vierge! <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Esprit! O mon Dieu! I could not breathe! miserable!
    je sui perdu! oh pourquoi have I been such fool to get into dese cold,
    cold arms! ‘Ba’tiste? (drawing me some tighter and tighter!) do you
    not belong to me, Ba’tiste?’ Yes, súppose! oh diable! belong? Oui,
    oui, je suis certainment perdu, lost, lost, for evare! <em>Oh! can you
    not possibe let me go?</em> ‘No, Ba’tiste, we must never part.’ Grand
    Dieu! c’est finis, finis, finis avec moi! “Then you do not love me any
    more, Ba’tiste?” Quel! quoi! what!! est ce vous, <em>Wee-ne-on-ka</em>?
    ‘Yes, Ba’tiste, it is the <em>Bending Willow</em> who holds you, she that
    loves you and will not let you go? Are you dreaming Ba’tiste?’ Oui,
    diable, ———!”</p>

  <p>“Well, Ba’tiste, that’s a very good story, and very well told; I
    presume you never tried again to get a medicine-bag?”</p>

  <p>“Non, Monsieur Bogard, je vous assure, I was satisfy wis de mistakes
    dat night, pour for je crois qu’il fut l’Esprit, le Grand Esprit.”</p>

  <p>After this, my entertaining companions sung several amusing songs, and
    then called upon me for another story. Which Mr. Wood had already heard
    me tell several times, and which he particularly called for; as</p>

  <h3><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“THE STORY OF THE DOG,”</span><br /></h3>

  <p class="noindent">and which I began as follows:—</p>

  <p>“Well, some time ago, when I was drifting down the mighty Missouri,
    in a little canoe, with two hired men, Bogard and Ba’tiste, (and in
    this manner <em>did</em> we glide along) amid all the pretty scenes and
    ugly, that decked the banks of that river, from the mouth of the Yellow
    Stone, to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, a distance of <em>only</em> two thousand miles;
    Bogard and Ba’tiste plied their paddles and I <em>steered</em>, amid snag
    and sand-bar—amongst drift logs and herds of swimming buffaloes—our
    beds were uniformly on the grass, or upon some barren beach, which we
    often chose, to avoid the suffocating clouds of musquitoes; our fire
    was (by the way we had none at night) kindled at sundown, under some
    towering bluff—our supper cooked and eaten, and we off again, floating
    some four or five miles after nightfall, when our canoe was landed
    at random, on some unknown shore. In whispering silence and darkness
    our buffalo robes were drawn out and spread upon the grass, and our
    bodies stretched upon them; our pistols were belted to our sides, and
    our rifles always slept in our arms. In this way we were encamped,
    and another robe drawn over us, head and foot, under which our iron
    slumbers were secure from the tread of all foes saving that of the
    sneaking gangs of wolves, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> were nightly serenading us with their
    harmonics, and often quarrelling for the privilege of chewing off the
    corners of the robe, which served us as a blanket. ‘Caleb’ (the grizzly
    bear) was often there too, leaving the print of his deep impressed
    footsteps where he had perambulated, reconnoitring, though not
    disturbing us. Our food was simply buffalo meat from day to day, and
    from morning till night, for coffee and bread we had not. The fleece
    (hump) of a fat cow, was the luxury of luxuries; and for it we would
    step ashore, or as often level our rifles upon the ‘slickest’ of the
    herds from our canoe, as they were grazing upon the banks. Sometimes
    the antelope, the mountain-sheep, and so the stately elk contributed
    the choicest cuts for our little larder; and at others, while in the
    vicinity of war-parties, where we dared not to fire our guns, our boat,
    was silently steered into some little cove or eddy, our hook and line
    dipped, and we trusted to the bite of a catfish for our suppers: if we
    got him, he was sometimes too large and tough; and if we got him not,
    we would swear, (not at all) and go to bed.</p>

  <p>“Our meals were generally cooked and eaten on piles of driftwood, where
    our fire was easily kindled, and a peeled log (which we generally
    straddled) did admirably well for a seat, and a table to eat from.</p>

  <p>“In this manner did we glide away from day to day, with anecdote and
    fun to shorten the time, and just enough of the <em>spice of danger</em>
    to give vigour to our stomachs, and keenness to our appetites—making
    and meeting accident and incident sufficient for a ‘book.’ Two hundred
    miles from the mouth of Yellow Stone brought us to the village of the
    kind and gentlemanly Mandans. With them I lived for some time—was
    welcomed—taken gracefully by the arm, by their plumed dignitaries, and
    feasted in their hospitable lodges. Much have I already said of these
    people, and more of them, a great deal, I may say at a future day;
    but now, to our ‘<em>story</em>.’ As <em>preamble</em>, however, having
    launched our light canoe at the Mandan village, shook hands with the
    chiefs and braves, and took the everlasting farewell glance at those
    <em>models</em>, which I wept to turn from; we dipped our paddles, and
    were again gliding off upon the mighty water, on our way to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.
    We travelled fast, and just as the village of the Mandans, and the bold
    promontory on which it stands, were changing to blue, and ‘dwindling
    into nothing,’ we heard the startling yells, and saw in distance behind
    us, the troop that was gaining upon us! their red shoulders were
    bounding over the grassy bluffs—their hands extended, and robes waving
    with signals for us to stop! In a few moments they were opposite to us
    on the bank, and I steered my boat to the shore. They were arranged for
    my reception, with amazement and orders imperative stamped on every
    brow. ‘Mi-neek-e-sunk-te-ka’ (the mink), they exclaimed, ‘is dying!
    the picture which you made of her is too much like her—you put so much
    of her into it, that when your boat took it away from our village, it
    drew a part of her life away with it—she is bleeding from her mouth—she
    is puking up all her blood; by taking that away, you are drawing the
    strings out of her heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> and they will soon break; we must take
    her picture back, and then she will get well—your <em>medicine</em> is
    great, it is too great; but we wish you well.’ Mr. Kipp, their Trader,
    came with the party, and interpreted as above. I unrolled my bundle
    of portraits, and though I was unwilling to part with it (for she
    was a beautiful girl), yet I placed it in their hands, telling them
    that I wished her well; and I was exceedingly glad to get my boat
    peaceably under way again, and into the current, having taken another
    and everlasting shake of the hands. They rode back at full speed with
    the portrait; but intelligence which I have since received from there,
    informs me that the girl died; and that I am for ever to be considered
    as the cause of her misfortunes. This is not <em>the</em> ‘<em>story</em>,’
    however, but I will tell it as soon as I can come to it. We dropped
    off, and down the rolling current again, from day to day, until at
    length the curling smoke of the Riccarees announced their village in
    view before us!</p>

  <p>“We trembled and quaked, for all boats not stoutly armed, steal by
    them in the dead of night. We muffled our paddles, and instantly
    dropped under some willows, where we listened to the yelping, barking
    rabble, until sable night had drawn her curtain around (though it was
    not <em>sable</em>, for the moon arose, to our great mortification and
    alarm, in full splendour and brightness), when, at eleven o’clock, we
    put out to the middle of the stream—silenced our paddles, and trusted
    to the current to waft us by them. We lay close in our boat with a
    pile of green bushes over us, making us nothing in the world but a
    ‘floating tree-top.’ On the bank, in front of the village, was enacting
    at that moment, a scene of the most frightful and thrilling nature. An
    hundred torches were swung about in all directions, giving us a full
    view of the group that were assembled, and some fresh scalps were hung
    on poles, and were then going through the nightly ceremony that is
    performed about them for a certain number of nights, composed of the
    frightful and appalling shrieks, and yells, and gesticulations of the
    <em>scalp-dance</em>.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>“In addition to this multitude of demons (as they looked), there
    were some hundreds of cackling women and girls bathing in the river
    on the edge of a sand-bar, at the lower end of the village; at which
    place the stream drifted our small craft in, close to the shore, till
    the moon lit their shoulders, their foreheads, chins, noses! and
    they stood, half-merged, like mermaids, and gazed upon us! singing
    ‘<i lang="mhq">Chee-na-see-nun, chee-na-see-nun ke-mon-shoo kee-ne-he-na,
    ha-way-tah? shee-sha, shee-sha</i>;’ ‘How do you do, how do you do?
    where are you going, old tree? Come here, come here.’ ‘<i lang="mhq">Lah-kee-hoon!
    lali kee-hoon! natoh, catogh!</i>’ (‘A canoe, a canoe! see the
    paddle!!’) In a moment the songs were stopped! the lights were
    out—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> village in an instant was in darkness, and dogs were muzzled!
    and nimbly did our paddles ply the water, till spy-glass told us at
    morning’s dawn, that the bank and boundless prairies of grass and
    green that were all around us, were free from following footsteps of
    friend or foe. A sleepless night had passed, and lightly tripped our
    bark, and swift, over the swimming tide during <em>that</em> day; which
    was one, not of pleasure, but of trembling excitement; while our eyes
    were continually scanning the distant scenes that were behind us, and
    our muscles throwing us forward with tireless energy. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * * * *</span>
    Night came upon us again, and we landed at the foot of a towering
    bluff, where the musquitoes met us with ten thousand kicks and cuffs,
    and importunities, until we were choked and strangled into almost
    irrevocable despair and madness.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

  <p>“A ‘<em>snaggy bend</em>’ announced its vicinity just below us by its
    roaring; and hovering night told us, that we could not with safety
    ‘undertake it.’</p>

  <p>“The only direful alternative was now in full possession of us, (I am
    not going to tell the ‘<em>story</em>’ <em>yet</em>), for just below us
    was a stately bluff of 200 feet in height, rising out of the water,
    at an angle of forty-five degrees, entirely denuded in front, and
    constituted of clay. <span lang="fr">‘Montons, montons!’</span> said Ba’tiste, as he hastily
    clambered up its steep inclined plane on his hands and feet, over
    its parched surface, which had been dried in the sun, <span lang="fr">‘essayez vous,
    essayez! ce’n’est pas difficile Monsr. Cataline,’</span> exclaimed he, from an
    elevation of about 100 feet from the water, where he had found a level
    platform, of some ten or fifteen feet in diameter, and stood at its
    brink, waving his hand over the twilight landscape that lay in partial
    obscurity beneath him.</p>

  <p>“‘Nous avons ici une belle place pour for to get some <em>slips</em>,
    some <em>coot slips</em>, vare de dam Riccaree et de dam muskeet shall
    nevare get si haut, by Gar! montez, montez en haut.’</p>

  <p>“Bogard and I took our buffalo robes and our rifles, and with
    difficulty hung and clung along in the crevices with fingers and
    toes, until we reached the spot. We found ourselves about half-way
    up the precipice, which continued almost perpendicular above us; and
    within a few yards of us, on each side, it was one unbroken slope
    from the bottom to the top. In this snug little nook were we most
    appropriately fixed, as we thought, for a warm summer’s night, out of
    the reach entirely of musquitoes, and all other earthly obstacles, as
    we supposed, to the approaching gratification, for which the toils and
    fatigues of the preceding day and night, had so admirably prepared
    us. We spread one of our robes, and having ranged ourselves side by
    side upon it, and drawn the other one over us, we commenced, without
    further delay, upon the pleasurable forgetfulness of toils and dangers
    which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>had agitated us for the past day and night. We had got just
    about to that stage of our enjoyment which is almost resistless, and
    nearly bidding defiance to every worldly obstrusive obstacle, when the
    pattering of rain on our buffalo robes opened our eyes to the dismal
    scene that was getting up about us! <em>My</em> head was out, and on the
    watch; but the other two skulls were flat upon the ground, and there
    chained by the unyielding links of iron slumber. The blackest of all
    clouds that ever swept hill tops of grass, of clay, or towering rock,
    was hanging about us—its lightning’s glare was incessantly flashing us
    to blindness; and the giddy elevation on which we were perched, seemed
    to tremble with the roar and jar of distant, and the instant bolts and
    cracks of present thunder! The rain poured and fell in torrents (its
    not enough); it seemed <em>floating</em> around and above us in waves
    succeeding waves, which burst upon the sides of the immense avalanche
    of clay that was above, and <em>slid</em> in <em>sheets</em>, upon us!
    Heavens! what a scene was here. The river beneath us and in distance,
    with windings infinite, whitening into silver, and trees, to deathlike
    paleness, at the lightning’s flash! All about us was drenched in rain
    and mud. At this juncture, poor Ba’tiste was making an effort to raise
    his head and shoulders—he was in agony! he had slept himself, and
    <em>slipt</em> himself partly from the robe, and his elbows were fastened
    in the mud.</p>

  <p>“‘Oh sacré, ’tis too bad by Gar! we can get some <em>slips</em> nevare.’</p>

  <p>“‘Ugh! (replied Yankee Bogard) we shall get ‘slips’ enough directly, by
    darn, for we are all afloat, and shall go into the river by and by,
    in the twinkling of a goat’s eye, if we don’t look out.’</p>

  <p>“We were nearly afloat, sure enough, and our condition growing more
    and more dreary every moment, and our only alternative was, to fold up
    our nether robe and sit upon it; hanging the other one over our heads,
    which formed a roof, and shielded the rain from us. To give compactness
    to the <em>trio</em>, and bring us into such shape as would enable the
    robe to protect us all, we were obliged to put our backs and occiputs
    together, and keep our heads from nodding. In this way we were enabled
    to divide equally the robe that we sat upon, as well as receive mutual
    benefit from the one that was above us. We thus managed to protect
    ourselves in the most important points, leaving our feet and legs (from
    necessity) to the mercy of mud.</p>

  <p>“Thus we were re-encamped. ‘A pretty mess’ (said I), we look like
    the ‘three graces;’—‘de tree grace, by Gar!’ said Ba’tiste. ‘Grace!
    (whispered Bogard) yes, it’s all <em>grace</em> here; and I believe we’ll
    all be buried in <em>grace</em> in less than an hour.’</p>

  <p>“‘Monsr. Cataline! excusez my back, si vous plait. Bogard! comment,
    comment?—bonne nuit, Messieurs. Oh! mon Dieu, mon Dieu! Je vous rends
    grace—je vous prie pour for me sauver ce nuit—delivrez nous! delivrez
    nous! Je vous adore, Saint Esprit—la Vierge Marie—oh je vous rends
    grace! pour for de m’avoir conservé from de dam Riccree et de diable
    muskeet. Eh bien! eh bien!’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

  <p>“In this miserable and despairing mood poor Ba’tiste dropped off
    gradually into a most tremendous sleep, whilst Bogard and I were
    holding on to our corners of the robe—recounting over the dangers and
    excitements of the day and night past, as well as other scenes of
    our adventurous lives, whilst we laid (or rather sat) looking at the
    lightning, with our eyes shut. Ba’tiste snored louder and louder, until
    sleep had got her strongest grip upon him; and his specific gravity
    became so great, that he pitched forward, pulling our corners of the
    robe nearly off from our heads, reducing us to the necessity of drawing
    upon them till we brought the back of his head in contact with ours,
    again, and his body in an erect posture, when he suddenly exclaimed.</p>

  <p>“‘Bon jour, Monsr. Bogard: bon jour, Monsr. Cataline; n’est ce pas
    morning, pretty near?’</p>

  <p>“‘No, its about midnight.’</p>

  <p>“‘Quel temps?’</p>

  <p>“Why it rains as hard as ever.</p>

  <p>“‘Oh diable, I wish I was <em>tó hell</em>.’</p>

  <p>“‘You may be there yet before morning, by darn.’</p>

  <p>“‘Pardón! pardón, Monsr Bogard—I shall not go to night, not <em>to</em>
    night, I was joke—mais! dis is not joke, sùppose—oh vengeance! I am
    slip down considerable—mais I shall not go to hell quite—I am slip off
    de seat!’</p>

  <p>“‘What! you are sitting in the mud?’</p>

  <p>“‘Oui, Bogard, in de muds! mais, I am content, my <em>head</em> is not
    in de mud. You see Bogard, I avait been sleep, et I raisee my head
    pretty suddain, and keepee my e back e straight, et I am slip off
    of de seat. Now, Monsr. Bogard you shall keepee you head straight
    and moove——————leet, at de bottom?———————remercie, Bogard,
    remercie,——eh bien,————ah well—————————ha—ha—h——a—by Gar, Bogard,
    I have a de good joke. Monsr. Cataline will paintez my likeeness as
    I am now look—he will paint us all—I am tink he will make putty coot
    view? ha-ha-ha-a——we should see very putty landeescape aboutee de legs,
    ha? Ha——ha——h———a——a.’</p>

  <p>“Oh, Ba’tiste, for Heaven’s sake stop your laughing and go to sleep;
    we’ll talk and laugh about this all day to-morrow.</p>

  <p>“‘Pardón, Monsr. Cataline, (excusez) have you got some slips?’</p>

  <p>“No, Ba’tiste, I have not been asleep. Bogard has been entertaining me
    these two hours whilst you was asleep, with a description of a buffalo
    hunt, which took place at the mouth of Yellow Stone, about a year ago.
    It must have been altogether a most splendid and thrilling scene, and I
    have been paying the strictest attention to it, for I intend to write
    it down and send it to New York for the cits to read.”</p>

  <p>“‘I like’e dat much, Monsr. Cataline, and I shall take much plaisir
    pout vous donner to give déscript of someting, provide you will write
    him down, ha?’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p>“Well Ba’tiste, go on, I am endeavouring to learn everything that’s
    curious and entertaining, belonging to this country.</p>

  <p>“‘Well Monsr. Cataline, I shall tell you someting very much entertain,
    mais, but, you will nevare tell somebody how we have been fix to night?
    ha?’</p>

  <p>“No, Ba’tiste, most assuredly I shall never mention it nor make
    painting of it.</p>

  <p>“‘Well, je commence,—diable Bogard! you shall keep your back straight
    you must sit up, ou il n’est pas possibe for to keep de robe ovare
    all. Je commence, Mons. Cataline, to describe some <em>Dog Feast</em>,
    which I attend among de dam Pieds noirs. I shall describe some grande,
    magnifique ceremonay, and you will write him down?’</p>

  <p>“Yes, I’ll put it on paper.</p>

  <p>“‘Pardón, pardón, I am get most to slip, I shall tell him to-morrow,
    pérhaps I shall———eh bien;—but you will nevare tell how we look, ha!
    Monsr. Cataline?’</p>

  <p>“No Ba’tiste, I’ll never mention it.</p>

  <p>“‘Eh bien———bon nuit.’</p>

  <p>“In this condition we sat, and in this manner we nodded away the night,
    as far as I recollect of it, catching the broken bits of sleep, (that
    were even painful to us when we got them), until the morning’s rays
    at length gave us a view of the scene that was around us!! Oh, all
    ye brick-makers, ye plasterers, and soft-soap manufacturers! put all
    your imaginations in a ferment together, and see if ye can invent a
    scene like this! Here <em>was</em> a ‘fix’ to be sure. The sun arose
    in splendour and in full, upon this everlasting and boundless scene
    of ‘<em>saft soap</em>’ and grease, which admitted us not to move. The
    whole hill was constituted entirely of tough clay, and on each side
    and above us there was no possibility of escape; and one single step
    over the brink of the place where we had ascended, would inevitably
    have launched us into the river below, the distance of an hundred
    feet! Here, looking like hogs just risen from a mud puddle, or a
    buffalo bull in his wallow, we sat, (<em>and had to sit</em>,) admiring
    the wide-spread and beautiful landscape that lay steeping and smoking
    before us, and our little boat, that looked like a nutshell beneath us,
    hanging at the shore; telling stories and filling up the while with
    nonsensical garrulity, until the sun’s warming rays had licked up the
    mud, and its dried surface, about eleven o’clock, gave us foothold,
    when we cautiously, but safely descended to the bottom; and then, at
    the last jump, which brought his feet to <em>terra firma</em>, Ba’tiste
    exclaimed, ‘Well, we have cheatee de dam muskeet, ha!’”</p>

  <p>And this, reader, is not ‘<em>the story</em>,’ but one of the little
    incidents which stood exactly in the way, and could not well be got
    over without a slight notice, being absolutely necessary, as a key, or
    kind of glossary, for the proper understanding of the tale that is to
    be told. There is <em>blood</em> and <em>butchery</em> in the story that is
    now to be related; and it should be read by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> every one who would form a
    correct notion of the force of Indian superstitions.</p>

  <p>Three mighty warriors, proud and valiant, licked the dust, and all in
    consequence of one of the portraits I painted; and as my brush was the
    prime mover of all these misfortunes, and my life was sought to heal
    the wound, I must be supposed to be knowing to and familiar with the
    whole circumstances, which were as—(I was going to say, as follow) but
    my want of time and your want of patience, compel me to break off here,
    and I promise to go right on with <em>the story of the Dog</em> in my
    next Letter, and I advise the reader not to neglect or overlook it.</p>

      Indians on the Continent; and in every instance have, I venture to
      say, been brought from the Côteau des Prairies, inasmuch as no tribe
      of Indians that I have yet visited, have ever apprized me of any other
      source than this; and the stone from which they are all manufactured,
      is of the same character exactly, and different from any known mineral
      compound ever yet discovered in any part of Europe, or other parts of
      the American Continent. This may be thought a broad assertion—yet it
      is one I have ventured to make (and one I should have had no motive
      for making, except for the purpose of eliciting information, if there
      be any, on a subject so curious and so exceedingly interesting). In my
      <span class="smcap">Indian Museum</span> there can always be seen a great many beautiful
      specimens of this mineral selected on the spot, by myself, embracing
      all of its numerous varieties; and I challenge the world to produce
      anything like it, except it be from the same locality. In a following

      years since, before the influence of Traders had deranged the system
      and truth of things, in these regions. I have often conversed
      with General Clark, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, on this subject, and he told me
      explicitly, and authorized me to say it to the world, that every tribe
      on the Missouri told him they had been to this place, and that the
      Great Spirit kept the peace amongst his red children on that ground,
      where they had smoked with their enemies.</div>

      <a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> The medicine (or leaping) rock is a part of the precipice
      which has become severed from the main part, standing about seven or
      eight feet from the wall, just equal in height, and about seven feet in
      diameter.

      <p>It stands like an immense column of thirty-five feet high, and highly
        polished on its top and sides. It requires a daring effort to leap on
        to its top from the main wall, and back again, and many a heart has
        sighed for the honour of the feat without daring to make the attempt.
        Some few have tried it with success, and left their arrows standing
        in its crevice, several of which are seen there at this time; others
        have leapt the chasm and fallen from the slippery surface on which
        they could not hold, and suffered instant death upon the craggy rocks
        below. Every young man in the nation is ambitious to perform this
        feat; and those who have successfully done it are allowed to boast of
        it all their lives. In the sketch already exhibited, there will be
        seen, a view of the “leaping rock;” and in the middle of the picture,
        a mound, of a conical form, of ten feet height, which was erected over
        the body of a distinguished young man who was killed by making this
        daring effort, about two years before I was there, and whose sad fate
        was related to me by a Sioux chief, who was father of the young man,
        and was visiting the Red Pipe Stone Quarry, with thirty others of his
        tribe, when we were there, and cried over the grave, as he related the

      <a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> On my return from the Pipe Stone Quarry, one of the old

      <p>“My friend, when I was young, I used to go with our young men to the
        mountain of the Red Pipe, and dig out pieces for our pipes. We do not
        go now; and our red pipes as you see, are few. The Dah-co-tah’s have
        spilled the blood of red men on that place, and the Great Spirit is
        offended. The white traders have told them to draw their bows upon us
        when we go there; and they have offered us many of the pipes for sale,
        but we do not want to smoke them, for we know that the Great Spirit is
        offended. My mark is on the rocks in many places, but I shall never see
        them again. They lie where the Great Spirit sees them, for his eye is
        over that place, and he sees everything that is here.”</p>

      <p>Ke-o-kuck chief of the Sacs and Foxes, when I asked him whether he had
        ever been there, replied—</p>

      <p>“No, I have never seen it; it is in our enemies’ country,—I wish it was

      <a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> Many and strong are the recollections of the Sioux and
      other tribes, of their alliance with the British in the last and
      revolutionary wars, of which I have met many curious instances, one of
      which was correctly reported in the London Globe, from my Lectures, and
      I here insert it.—

      <div class="center mt2">THE GLOBE AND TRAVELLER.</div>

      <p>“<i>Indian Knowledge of English Affairs</i>—Mr. Catlin, in one
        of his Lectures on the manners and customs of the North American
        Indians, during the last week, related a very curious occurrence,
        which excited a great deal of surprise and some considerable mirth
        amongst his highly respectable and numerous audience. Whilst
        speaking of the great and warlike tribe of Sioux or Dahcotas, of
        40,000 or 50,000, he stated that many of this tribe, as well as of
        several others, although living entirely in the territory of the
        United States, and several hundred miles south of her Majesty’s
        possessions, were found cherishing a lasting friendship for the
        English, whom they denominate Saganosh. And in very many instances
        they are to be seen wearing about their necks large silver medals,
        with the portrait of George <abbr title="Third">III.</abbr> in bold relief upon them. These
        medals were given to them as badges of merit during the last war
        with the United States, when these warriors were employed in the
        British service.</p>

      <p>“The Lecturer said, that whenever the word Saganosh was used,
        it seemed to rouse them at once; that on several occasions when
        Englishmen had been in his company as fellow-travellers, they had
        marked attentions paid them by these Indians as Saganoshes. And on
        one occasion, in one of his last rambles in that country, where
        he had painted several portraits in a small village of Dahcotas,
        the chief of the band positively refused to sit; alleging as his
        objection that the pale faces, who were not to be trusted, might
        do some injury to his portrait, and his health or his life might
        be affected by it. The painter, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>as he was about to saddle his
        horse for his departure, told the Indian that he was a Saganosh,
        and was going across the Big Salt Lake, and was very sorry that
        he could not carry the picture of so distinguished a man. At this
        intelligence the Indian advanced, and after a hearty grip of the
        hand, very carefully and deliberately withdrew from his bosom, and
        next to his naked breast, a large silver medal, and turning his
        face to the painter, pronounced with great vehemence and emphasis
        the word Sag-a-nosh! The artist, supposing that he had thus gained
        his point with the Indian Sagamore, was making preparation to
        proceed with his work, when the Indian still firmly denied him
        the privilege—holding up the face of his Majesty (which had got a
        superlative brightness by having been worn for years against his
        naked breast), he made this singular and significant speech:—‘When
        you cross the Big Salt Lake, tell my Great Father that you saw his
        face, and it was bright!’ To this the painter replied, ‘I can never
        see your Great Father, he is dead!’ The poor Indian recoiled in
        silence, and returned his medal to his bosom, entered his wigwam,
        at a few paces distant, where he seated himself amidst his family
        around his fire, and deliberately lighting his pipe, passed it
        around in silence.</p>

      <p>“When it was smoked out he told them the news he had heard, and in
        a few moments returned to the traveller again, who was preparing
        with his party to mount their horses, and enquired whether the
        Saganoshes had no chief. The artist replied in the affirmative,
        saying that the present chief of the Saganoshes is a <em>young</em>
        and <em>very beautiful woman</em>. The Sagamore expressed great
        surprise and some incredulity at this unaccountable information;
        and being fully assured by the companions of the artist that his
        assertion was true, the Indian returned again quite hastily to
        his wigwam, called his own and the neighbouring families into his
        presence, lit and smoked another pipe, and then communicated the
        intelligence to them, to their great surprise and amusement; after
        which he walked out to the party about to start off, and advancing
        to the painter (or Great Medicine as they called him), with a
        sarcastic smile on his face, in due form, and with much grace and
        effect, he carefully withdrew again from his bosom the polished
        silver medal, and turning the face to the painter, said, ‘Tell my
        <em>Great Mother</em>, that you saw our Great Father, and that we
        keep his face bright!’”</p>
    </div>

      <a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> This gentleman, the summer previous to this, while I was
      in company with him at Prairie du Chien, gave me a very graphic account

      accuracy.</div>

    <div class="footnote">

      and after I had got some hundreds of miles below them, I learned that
      they were dancing two white men’s scalps taken in revenge for that
      inhuman act.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, to proceed with the <em>Story of the Dog</em>, which I promised;
    (after which I shall record the tale of <em>Wi-jun-jon</em>, the pigeon’s
    egg head), which was also told by me during the last night, before we
    retired to rest.</p>

  <p>“I think I said that my little canoe had brought us down the Missouri,
    about eight hundred miles below the mouth of Yellow Stone, when we
    landed at Laidlaw’s Trading-house, which is twelve hundred miles above
    civilization and the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis. If I did <em>not</em> say it,
    it is no matter, for it was even so; and ‘Ba’tiste and Bogard who had
    paddled, and I who had steered,’ threw our little bark out upon the
    bank, and taking our paddles in our hands, and our ‘<em>plunder</em>’
    upon our backs, crossed the plain to the American Fur Company’s Fort,
    in charge of Mr. Laidlaw, who gave us a hearty welcome; and placed
    us in an instant at his table, which happened at that moment to be
    stationed in the middle of the floor, distributing to its surrounding
    guests the simple blessings which belong to that fair and silent land
    of buffalo-tongues and beavers’ tails! A bottle of good Madeira wine
    sprung (à l’instant) upon the corner of the table, before us, and
    <em>swore, point blank</em>, to the welcome that was expressed in every
    feature of our host. After the usual salutations, the news, and a
    glass of wine, Mr. Laidlaw began thus;—“Well, my friend, you have got
    along well, so far; and I am glad to see you. You have seen a great
    many fine Indians since you left here, and have, no doubt, procured
    many interesting and valuable <em>portraits</em>; but there has been a
    deal of trouble about the ‘<em>pictures</em>,’ in this neighbourhood,
    since you went away. Of course, you have heard nothing of it at the
    Yellow Stone; but amongst us, I assure you, there has not a day passed
    since you left, without some fuss or excitement about the portraits.
    The ‘Dog’ is not yet dead, though he has been shot at several times,
    and had his left arm broken. The ‘Little <em>Bear’s</em>’ friends have
    overtaken the brother of the Dog, that fine fellow whom you painted,
    and killed him! They are now sensible that they have sacrificed one of
    the best men in the nation, for one of the greatest rascals; and they
    are more desperately bent on revenge than ever. They have made frequent
    enquiries for you, knowing that you had gone up the river; alleging
    that you had been the cause of these deaths, and that if the Dog
    could not be found, they should look to you for a settlement of that
    unfortunate affair!</p>

  <p>“‘That unlucky business, taken altogether, has been the greatest piece
    of <em>medicine</em> (mystery), and created the greatest excitement
    amongst the Sioux, of anything that has happened since I came into
    the country. My dear Sir,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> you must not continue your voyage down the
    river, in your unprotected condition. A large party of the ‘Little
    Bear’s’ band, are now encamped on the river below, and for you to
    stop there (which you might be obliged to do), would be to endanger
    your life.’” <span class="gesperrtstar">* * *</span> Reader, sit still, and let me change ends with my
    story, (which is done in one moment,) and then, from a relation of the
    circumstances which elicited the friendly advice and caution of Mr.
    Laidlaw just mentioned, you will be better enabled to understand the
    nature of the bloody affair which I am undertaking to relate.</p>

  <p>“About four months previous to the moment I am now speaking of, I had
    passed up the Missouri river by this place, on the steam-boat Yellow
    Stone, on which I ascended the Missouri to the mouth of Yellow Stone
    river. While going up, this boat, having on board the United States
    Indian agent, Major Sanford—Messrs. Pierre, Chouteau, McKenzie of
    the American Fur Company, and myself, as passengers, stopped at this
    trading-post, and remained several weeks; where were assembled six
    hundred families of Sioux Indians, their tents being pitched in close
    order on an extensive prairie on the bank of the river.</p>

  <p>“This trading-post, in charge of Mr. Laidlaw, is the concentrating
    place, and principal trading depôt, for this powerful tribe, who
    number, when all taken together, something like forty or fifty
    thousand. On this occasion, five or six thousand had assembled to
    see the steam-boat and meet the Indian agent, which, and whom they
    knew were to arrive about this time. During the few weeks that we
    remained there, I was busily engaged painting my portraits, for here
    were assembled the principal chiefs and <em>medicine-men</em> of the
    nation. To these people, the operations of my brush were entirely new
    and unaccountable, and excited amongst them the greatest curiosity
    imaginable. Every thing else (even the steam-boat) was abandoned
    for the pleasure of crowding into my painting-room, and witnessing
    the result of each fellow’s success, as he came out from under the
    operation of my brush.</p>

  <p>“They had been at first much afraid of the consequences that might
    flow from so strange and unaccountable an operation; but having been
    made to understand my views, they began to look upon it as a great
    <em>honour</em>, and afforded me the opportunities that I desired;
    exhibiting the utmost degree of vanity for their appearance, both as
    to features and dress. The consequence was, that my room was filled
    with the chiefs who sat around, arranged according to the rank or grade
    which they held in the estimation of their tribe; and in this order
    it became necessary for me to paint them, to the exclusion of those
    who never signalized themselves, and were without any distinguishing
    character in society.</p>

  <p>“The first man on the list, was <em>Ha-wan-ghee-ta</em> (one horn), head
    chief of the nation, of whom I have heretofore spoken; and after him
    the subordinate chiefs, or chiefs of bands, according to the estimation
    in which they were held by the chief and the tribe. My models were thus
    <em>placed</em> before me, whether ugly or beautiful, all the same, and
    I saw at once there was to be trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> somewhere, as I could not paint
    them all. The medicine-men or high priests, who are esteemed by many
    the oracles of the nation, and the most important men in it—becoming
    jealous, commenced their harangues, outside of the lodge, telling them
    that they were all fools—that those who were painted would soon die in
    consequence; and that these pictures, which had life to a considerable
    degree in them, would live in the hands of white men after they were
    dead, and make them sleepless and endless trouble.</p>

  <p>“Those whom I had painted, though evidently somewhat alarmed, were
    unwilling to acknowledge it, and those whom I had not painted,
    unwilling to be outdone in courage, allowed me the privilege; braving
    and defying the danger that they were evidently more or less in
    dread of. Feuds began to arise too, among some of the chiefs of the
    different bands, who (not unlike some instances amongst the chiefs and
    warriors of our own country), had looked upon their rival chiefs with
    unsleeping jealousy, until it had grown into disrespect and enmity. An
    instance of this kind presented itself at this critical juncture, in
    this assembly of inflammable spirits, which changed in a moment, its
    features, from the free and jocular garrulity of an Indian levee, to
    the frightful yells and agitated treads and starts of an Indian battle!
    I had in progress at this time a portrait of <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em>
    (little bear); of the <em>Onc-pa-pa band</em>, a noble fine fellow, who
    was sitting before me as I was painting (<a href="#i_273"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 273</a>). I was
    painting almost a profile view of his face, throwing a part of it
    into shadow, and had it nearly finished, when an Indian by the name
    of <em>Shon-ka</em> (the dog), chief of the <em>Caz-a-zshee-ta</em> band
    (<a href="#i_273"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 275</a>); an ill-natured and surly man—despised by the
    chiefs of every other band, entered the wigwam in a sullen mood, and
    seated himself on the floor in front of my sitter, where he could have
    a full view of the picture in its operation. After sitting a while
    with his arms folded, and his lips stiffly arched with contempt; he
    sneeringly spoke thus:—</p>

  <p>‘<em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> is but <em>half a man</em>.’ <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * *</span> “Dead
    silence ensued for a moment, and nought was in motion save the eyes of
    the chiefs, who were seated around the room, and darting their glances
    about upon each other in listless anxiety to hear the sequel that
    was to follow! During this interval, the eyes of Mah-to-tchee-ga had
    not moved—his lips became slightly curved, and he pleasantly asked,
    in low and steady accent, ‘Who says that?’ ‘<em>Shon-ka</em> says it,’
    was the reply; ‘and <em>Shon-ka</em> can prove it.’ At this the eyes
    of Mah-to-tchee-ga, which had not yet moved, began steadily to turn,
    and slow, as if upon pivots, and when they were rolled out of their
    sockets till they had fixed upon the object of their contempt; his
    dark and jutting brows were shoving down in trembling contention, with
    the blazing rays that were actually <em>burning</em> with contempt, the
    object that was before them. ‘<em>Why</em> does Shon-ka say it?’</p>

  <p>“‘Ask <em>We-chash-a-wa-kon</em> (the painter), he can tell you; he knows
    you are but <em>half a man</em>—he has painted but one half of your face,
    and knows the other half is good for nothing!’</p>

  </figure >

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

  <p>“‘Let the <em>painter</em> say it, and I will believe it; but when the
    Dog says it let him <em>prove</em> it.’</p>

  <p>“‘<em>Shon-ka</em> said it, and <em>Shon-ka</em> can prove it; if
    <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> be a man, and wants to be honoured by the white
    men, let him not be ashamed; but let him do as <em>Shon-ka</em> has done,
    give the white man a horse, and then let him see the <em>whole of your
    face</em> without being ashamed.’</p>

  <p>“‘When <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> kills a white man and <em>steals</em> his
    horses, he may be ashamed to look at a white man until he brings him a
    horse! When <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> waylays and murders an honourable
    and a brave Sioux, because he is a coward and not brave enough to
    meet him in fair combat, <em>then</em> he may be ashamed to look at a
    white man till he has given him a horse! <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> can
    look at any one; and he is now looking at an <em>old woman</em> and a
    <em>coward</em>!’</p>

  <p>“This repartee, which had lasted for a few minutes, to the amusement
    and excitement of the chiefs, being ended thus:—The Dog rose suddenly
    from the ground, and wrapping himself in his robe, left the wigwam,
    considerably agitated, having the laugh of all the chiefs upon him.</p>

  <p>“The Little Bear had followed him with his piercing eyes until he
    left the door, and then pleasantly and unmoved, resumed his position,
    where he sat a few minutes longer, until the portrait was completed.
    He then rose, and in the most graceful and gentlemanly manner,
    presented to me a very beautiful shirt of buckskin, richly garnished
    with quills of the porcupine, fringed with scalp-locks (honourable
    memorials) from his enemies’ heads, and painted, with all his battles
    emblazoned on it. He then left my wigwam, and a few steps brought him
    to the door of his own, where the Dog intercepted him, and asked,
    ‘What meant <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> by the last words that he spoke to
    <em>Shon-ka</em>?’ ‘<em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em> said it, and <em>Shon-ka</em> is
    not a fool—that is enough.’ At this the Dog walked violently to his own
    lodge; and the Little Bear retreated into his, both knowing from looks
    and gestures what was about to be the consequence of their altercation.</p>

  <p>“The Little Bear instantly charged his gun, and then (as their custom
    is) threw himself upon his face, in humble supplication to the Great
    Spirit for his aid and protection. His wife, in the meantime, seeing
    him agitated, and fearing some evil consequences, without knowing
    anything of the preliminaries, secretly withdrew the bullet from his
    gun, and told him not of it.</p>

  <p>“The Dog’s voice, at this moment, was heard, and recognized at the door
    of Mah-to-tchee-ga’s lodge,—‘If Mah-to-tchee-ga be a <em>whole</em> man,
    let him come out and prove it; it is <em>Shon-ka</em> that calls him!’</p>

  <p>“His wife screamed; but it was too late. The gun was in his hand, and
    he sprang out of the door—both drew and simultaneously fired! The Dog
    fled uninjured; but the Little Bear lay weltering in his blood (strange
    to say!) with all that side of his face entirely shot away, which had
    been left out of the picture; and, according to the prediction of the
    Dog, ‘<em>good for nothing</em>;’ carrying away one half of the jaws,
    and the flesh from the nostrils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> and corner of the mouth, to the ear,
    including one eye, and leaving the jugular vein entirely exposed.
    Here was a ‘coup;’ and anyone accustomed to the thrilling excitement
    that such scenes produce in an Indian village, can form <em>some</em>
    idea of the frightful agitation amidst several thousand Indians, who
    were divided into jealous bands or clans, under ambitious and rival
    chiefs! In one minute, a thousand guns and bows were seized! A thousand
    thrilling yells were raised; and many were the fierce and darting
    warriors who sallied round the Dog for his protection—he fled amidst
    a shower of bullets and arrows; but his braves were about him! The
    blood of the <em>Onc-pa-pas</em> was roused, and the indignant braves
    of that gallant band rushed forth from all quarters, and, swift upon
    their heels, were hot for vengeance! On the plain, and in full view of
    us, for some time, the whizzing arrows flew, and so did bullets, until
    the Dog and his brave followers were lost in distance on the prairie!
    In this rencontre, the Dog had his left arm broken; but succeeded, at
    length, in making his escape.</p>

  <p>“On the next day after this affair took place, the Little Bear died of
    his wound, and was buried amidst the most pitiful and heart-rending
    cries of his distracted wife, whose grief was inconsolable at the
    thought of having been herself the immediate and innocent cause of his
    death, by depriving him of his supposed protection.</p>

  <p>“This marvellous and fatal transaction was soon talked through the
    village, and the eyes of all this superstitious multitude were fixed
    upon me as the cause of the calamity—my paintings and brushes were
    instantly packed, and all hands, both Traders and Travellers, assumed
    at once a posture of defence.</p>

  <p>“I evaded, no doubt, in a great measure, the concentration of their
    immediate censure upon me, by expressions of great condolence, and
    by distributing liberal presents to the wife and relations of the
    deceased; and by uniting also with Mr. Laidlaw and the other gentlemen,
    in giving him honourable burial, where we placed over his grave a
    handsome Sioux lodge, and hung a white flag to wave over it.</p>

  <p>“On this occasion, many were the tears that were shed for the brave
    and honourable Mah-to-tchee-ga, and all the warriors of his band swore
    sleepless vengeance on the Dog, until his life should answer for the
    loss of their chief and leader.</p>

  <p>“On the day that he was buried, I started for the mouth of Yellow
    Stone, and while I was gone, the spirit of vengeance had pervaded
    nearly all the Sioux country in search of the Dog, who had evaded
    pursuit. His brother, however (<a href="#i_273"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 274</a>), a noble and
    honourable fellow, esteemed by all who knew him, fell in their way in
    an unlucky hour, when their thirst for vengeance was irresistible, and
    they slew him. Repentance deep, and grief were the result of so rash an
    act, when they beheld a brave and worthy man fall for so worthless a
    character; and as they became exasperated, the spirit of revenge grew
    more desperate than ever, and they swore they never would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> lay down
    their arms or embrace their wives and children until vengeance, full
    and complete, should light upon the head that deserved it. This brings
    us again to the first part of my story, and in this state were things
    in that part of the country, when I was descending the river, four
    months afterwards, and landed my canoe as I before stated, at Laidlaw’s
    trading-house.</p>

  <p>“The excitement had been kept up all summer amongst these people, and
    their superstitions bloated to the full brim, from circumstances so
    well calculated to feed and increase them. Many of them looked to me
    at once as the author of all these disasters, considering I knew that
    one half of the man’s face was <em>good for nothing</em>, or that I
    would not have left it out of the picture, and that I must therefore
    have foreknown the evils that were to flow from the omission; they
    consequently resolved that I was a dangerous man, and should suffer for
    my temerity in case the Dog could not be found. Councils had been held,
    and in all the solemnity of Indian <em>medicine</em> and <em>mystery</em>,
    I had been doomed to die! At one of these, a young warrior of the
    <em>Onc-pa-pa</em> band, arose and said, ‘The blood of two chiefs has
    just sunk into the ground, and an hundred bows are bent which are
    ready to shed more! on whom shall we bend them? I am a friend to the
    white men, but here is one whose medicine is too great—he is a great
    <em>medicine-man</em>! his <em>medicine</em> is too great! he was the
    death of Mah-to-tchee-ga! he made only one side of his face! he would
    not make the other—the side that he made was alive; the other was dead,
    and Shon-ka shot it off! How is this? Who is to die.’</p>

  <p>“After him, <em>Tah-zee-kee-da-cha</em> (torn belly), of the
    <em>Yankton</em> band, arose and said—‘Father, this medicine-man has
    done much harm! You told our chiefs and warriors, that they must be
    painted—you said he was a good man, and we believed you!—you thought
    so, my father, but you see what he has done!—he looks at our chiefs
    and our women and then makes them alive!! In this way he has taken our
    chiefs away, and he can trouble their spirits when they are dead!—they
    will be unhappy. If he can make them alive by looking at them, he can
    do us much harm!—you tell us that they are not alive—we see their eyes
    move!—their eyes follow us wherever we go, that is enough! I have
    no more to say!’ After him, rose a young man of the Onc-pa-pa band
    ‘Father! you know that I am the brother of <em>Mah-to-tchee-ga</em>!—-you
    know that I loved him—both sides of his face were good, and the
    medicine-man knew it also! Why was half of his face left out? He never
    was ashamed, but always looked white man in the face! Why was that side
    of his face shot off? Your friend is not our friend, and has forfeited
    his life—we want you to tell us where he is—we want to see him!’</p>

  <p>“Then rose Toh-ki-e-to (a <em>medicine-man</em> of the Yankton band, and
    principal orator of the nation.) ‘My friend, these are young men that
    speak—I am not afraid! your white medicine-man painted my picture,
    and it was good—I am glad of it—I am very glad to see that I shall
    live after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> I am dead!—I am old and not afraid!—some of our young men
    are foolish I know that this man <em>put many of our buffaloes in his
    book</em>! for I was with him, and we have had no buffaloes since to
    eat, it is true—but I am not afraid!! <em>his medicine</em> is great and
    I wish him well—we are friends!’</p>

  <p>“In this wise was the subject discussed by these superstitious
    people during my absence, and such were the reasons given by my
    friend Mr. Laidlaw, for his friendly advice; wherein he cautioned me
    against exposing my life in their hands, advising me to take some
    other route than that which I was pursuing down the river, where I
    would find encamped at the mouth of Cabri river, eighty miles below,
    several hundred Indians belonging to the Little Bear’s band, and I
    might possibly fall a victim to their unsatiated revenge. I resumed
    my downward voyage in a few days, however, with my little canoe,
    which ‘Ba’tiste and Bogard paddled and I steered,’ and passed their
    encampment in peace, by taking the opposite shore. The usual friendly
    invitation however, was given (which is customary on that river), by
    skipping several rifle bullets across the river, a rod or two ahead
    of us. To those invitations we paid no attention, and (not suspecting
    who we were), they allowed us to pursue our course in peace and
    security. Thus rested the affair of the Dog and its consequences, until
    I conversed with Major Bean, the agent for these people, who arrived
    in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis some weeks after I did, bringing later intelligence from
    them, assuring me that ‘<em>the Dog had at length been overtaken and
    killed</em>, near the Black-hills, and that the affair might now for
    ever be considered as settled.’”</p>

  <p>Thus happened, and thus terminated the affair of “the Dog,” wherein
    have fallen three distinguished warriors; and wherein <em>might</em> have
    fallen one “<em>great medicine-man</em>!” and all in consequence of the
    operations of my brush. The portraits of the three first named will
    long hang in my Gallery for the world to gaze upon; and the head of the
    latter (whose hair yet remains on it), may probably be seen (for a time
    yet) occasionally stalking about in the midst of this Collection of
    Nature’s dignitaries.</p>

  <p>The circumstances above detailed, are as correctly given as I could
    furnish them! and they have doubtless given birth to one of the most
    wonderful traditions, which will be told and sung amongst the Sioux
    Indians from age to age; furnishing one of the rarest instances,
    perhaps, on record, of the extent to which these people may be carried
    by the force of their superstitions.</p>

  <p>After I had related this curious and unfortunate affair, I was called
    upon to proceed at once with the</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">STORY OF WI-JUN-JON (the pigeon’s egg head);</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">and I recited it as I first told it to poor Ba’tiste, on a former
    occasion, which was as follows:—</p>

  <p>“Well, Ba’tiste, I promised last night, as you were going to sleep,
    that I would tell you a story this morning—did I not?</p>

  <p>“Oui, Monsieur, oui—de ‘Pigeon’s Head.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

  <p>“No, Ba’tiste, the ‘Pigeon’s Egg Head.’</p>

  <p>“‘Well den, Monsieur Cataline, de ‘Pigeon Egg’s Head.’</p>

  <p>“No, Ba’tiste, you have it wrong yet. The Pigeon’s Egg Head.</p>

  <p>“‘Sacré—well, ‘<em>Pee—jonse—ec—head</em>.’</p>

  <p>“Right, Ba’tiste. Now you shall hear the ‘Story of the Pigeon’s Egg
    Head.’</p>

  <p>“The Indian name of this man (being its literal translation into the
    Assinneboin language) was Wi-jun-jon.</p>

  <p>“‘Wat! comment! by Gar (pardón); not <em>Wi-jun-jon</em>, le frere de ma
    douce <em>Wee-ne-on-ka</em>, fils du chef Assinneboin? But excusez; go
    on, s’il vous plait.’</p>

  <p>“<em>Wi-jun-jon</em> (the Pigeon’s Egg Head) was a brave and a warrior
    of the Assinneboins—young—proud—handsome—valiant, and graceful. He had
    fought many a battle, and won many a laurel. The numerous scalps from
    his enemies’ heads adorned his dress, and his claims were fair and just
    for the highest honours that his country could bestow upon him; for his
    father was chief of the nation.</p>

  <p>“Le meme! de same—mon frere—mon ami! Bien, I am composé; go on,
    Monsieur.’</p>

  <p>“Well, this young Assinneboin, the ‘Pigeon’s Egg Head,’ was selected by
    Major Sanford, the Indian Agent, to represent his tribe in a delegation
    which visited Washington city under his charge in the winter of 1832.
    With this gentleman, the Assinneboin, together with representatives
    from several others of those North Western tribes, descended the
    Missouri river, several thousand miles, on their way to Washington.</p>

  <p>“While descending the river in a Mackinaw boat, from the mouth of
    Yellow Stone, Wi-jun-jon and another of his tribe who was with him, at
    the first approach to the civilized settlements, commenced a register
    of the white men’s houses (or cabins), by cutting a notch for each on
    the side of a pipe-stem, in order to be able to shew when they got
    home, how many white men’s houses they saw on their journey. At first
    the cabins were scarce; but continually as they advanced down the
    river, more and more rapidly increased in numbers; and they soon found
    their pipe-stem filled with marks, and they determined to put the rest
    of them on the handle of a war-club, which they soon got marked all
    over likewise; and at length, while the boat was moored at the shore
    for the purpose of cooking the dinner of the party, <em>Wi-jun-jon</em>
    and his companion stepped into the bushes, and cut a long stick, from
    which they peeled the bark; and when the boat was again underweigh,
    they sat down, and with much labour, copied the notches on to it from
    the pipe-stem and club; and also kept adding a notch for every house
    they passed. This stick was soon filled; and in a day or two several
    others; when, at last, they seemed much at a loss to know what to do
    with their troublesome records, until they came in sight of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis,
    which is a town of 15,000 inhabitants; upon which, after consulting a
    little, they pitched their sticks overboard into the river!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

  <p>I was at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis at the time of their arrival, and painted their
    portraits while they rested in that place. <em>Wi-jun-jon</em> was the
    first, who reluctantly yielded to the solicitations of the Indian agent
    and myself, and appeared as sullen as death in my painting-room—with
    eyes fixed like those of a statue, upon me, though his pride had plumed
    and tinted him in all the freshness and brilliancy of an Indian’s
    toilet. In his nature’s uncowering pride he stood a perfect model; but
    superstition had hung a lingering curve upon his lip, and pride had
    stiffened it into contempt. He had been urged into a measure, against
    which his fears had pleaded; yet he stood unmoved and unflinching amid
    the struggles of mysteries that were hovering about him, foreboding
    ills of every kind, and misfortunes that were to happen to him in
    consequence of this operation.</p>

  <p>“He was dressed in his native costume, which was classic and
    exceedingly beautiful (<a href="#i_271"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 271</a>); his leggings and shirt
    were of the mountain-goat skin, richly garnished with quills of the
    porcupine, and fringed with locks of scalps, taken from his enemies’
    heads. Over these floated his long hair in plaits, that fell nearly
    to the ground; his head was decked with the war-eagle’s plumes—his
    robe was of the skin of the young buffalo bull, richly garnished and
    emblazoned with the battles of his life; his quiver and bow were slung,
    and his shield, of the skin of the bull’s neck.</p>

  <p>“I painted him in this beautiful dress, and so also the others who were
    with him; and after I had done, Major Sanford went on to Washington
    with them, where they spent the winter.</p>

  <p>“<em>Wi-jun-jon</em> was the foremost on all occasions—the first to enter
    the levee—the first to shake the President’s hand, and make his speech
    to him—the last to extend the hand to them, but the first to catch
    the smiles and admiration of the gentler sex. He travelled the giddy
    maze, and beheld amid the buzzing din of civil life, their tricks of
    art, their handiworks, and their finery; he visited their principal
    cities—he saw their forts, their ships, their great guns, steamboats,
    balloons, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and in the spring returned to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, where I
    joined him and his companions on their way back to their own country.</p>

  <p>“Through the politeness of Mr. Chouteau, of the American Fur Company,
    I was admitted (the only passenger except Major Sanford and his
    Indians) to a passage in their steamboat, on her first trip to the
    Yellow Stone; and when I had embarked, and the boat was about to
    depart, <em>Wi-jun-jon</em> made his appearance on deck, in a full
    suit of regimentals! He had in Washington exchanged his beautifully
    garnished and classic costume, for a full dress ‘en militaire’
    (see <a href="#i_271"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 272</a>). It was, perhaps, presented to him by the
    President. It was broadcloth, of the finest blue, trimmed with lace of
    gold; on his shoulders were mounted two immense epaulettes; his neck
    was strangled with a shining black stock, and his feet were pinioned in
    a pair of water proof boots, with high heels, which made him ‘step like
    a yoked hog.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

  <p>“‘Ha-ha-hagh (pardón, Monsieur Cataline, for I am almost laugh)—well,
    he was a fine genteman, ha?’</p>

  <p>“On his head was a high-crowned beaver hat, with a broad silver lace
    band, surmounted by a huge red feather, some two feet, high; his coat
    collar stiff with lace, came higher up than his ears, and over it
    flowed, down towards his haunches—his long Indian locks, stuck up in
    rolls and plaits, with red paint.</p>

  <p>“‘Ha-ha-hagh-agh-ah.’</p>

  <p>“Hold your tongue, Ba’tiste.</p>

  <p>“‘Well, go on—go on.’</p>

  <p>‘A large silver medal was suspended from his neck by a blue ribbon—and
    across his right shoulder passed a wide belt, supporting by his side a
    broad sword.</p>

  <p>“‘Diable!’</p>

  <p>“On his hands he had drawn a pair of white kid gloves, and in them
    held, a blue umbrella in one, and a large fan in the other. In
    this fashion was poor Wi-jun-jon metamorphosed, on his return from
    Washington; and, in this plight was he strutting and whistling Yankee
    Doodle, about the deck of the steamer that was wending its way up the
    mighty Missouri, and taking him to his native land again; where he was
    soon to light his pipe, and cheer the wigwam fire-side, with tales of
    novelty and wonder.</p>

  <p>“Well, Ba’tiste, I travelled with this new-fangled gentleman until
    he reached his home, two thousand miles above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and I could
    never look upon him for a moment without excessive laughter, at the
    ridiculous figure he cut—the strides, the angles, the stiffness of this
    travelling beau! Oh Ba’tiste, if you could have seen him, you would
    have split your sides with laughter; he was—‘puss in boots,’ precisely!</p>

  <p>“‘By gar, he is good compare! Ha-ha, Monsieur: (pardón) I am laugh: I
    am see him wen he is arrive in Yellow Stone; you know I was dere. I am
    laugh much wen he is got off de boat, and all de Assinneboins was dere
    to look. Oh diable! I am laugh almost to die, I am split!—súppose he
    was pretty stiff, ha?—‘cob on spindle,’ ha? Oh, by gar, he is coot pour
    laugh—pour rire?’</p>

  <p>“After Wi-jun-jon had got home, and passed the usual salutations among
    his friends, he commenced the simple narration of scenes he had passed
    through, and of things he had beheld among the whites; which appeared
    to them so much like fiction, that it was impossible to believe them,
    and they set him down as an impostor. ‘He has been, (they said,) among
    the whites, who are great liars, and all he has learned is to come home
    and tell lies.’ He sank rapidly into disgrace in his tribe; his high
    claims to political eminence all vanished; he was reputed worthless—the
    greatest, liar of his nation; the chiefs shunned him and passed him
    by as one of the tribe who was lost; yet the ears of the gossipping
    portion of the tribe were open, and the camp-fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> circle and the
    wigwam fire-side, gave silent audience to the whispered narratives of
    the ‘travelled Indian.’ <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * *</span></p>

  <p>“The next day after he had arrived among his friends, the superfluous
    part of his coat, (which was a laced frock), was converted into
    a pair of leggings for his wife; and his hat-band of silver lace
    furnished her a magnificent pair of garters. The remainder of the coat,
    curtailed of its original length, was seen buttoned upon the shoulders
    of his brother, over and above a pair of leggings of buckskin; and
    <em>Wi-jun-jon</em> was parading about among his gaping friends, with
    a bow and quiver slung over his shoulders, which, <em>sans coat</em>,
    exhibited a fine linen shirt with studs and sleeve buttons. His
    broad-sword kept its place, but about noon, his boots gave way to a
    pair of garnished moccasins; and in such plight he gossipped away
    the day among his friends, while his heart spoke so freely and so
    effectually from the bung-hole of a little keg of whiskey, which he had
    brought the whole way, (as one of the choicest presents made him at
    Washington), that his tongue became silent.</p>

  <p>“One of his little fair enamoratas, or ‘catch crumbs,’ such as live
    in the halo of all great men, fixed her eyes and her affections upon
    his beautiful silk braces, and the next day, while the keg was yet
    dealing out its kindnesses, he was seen paying visits to the lodges
    of his old acquaintance, swaggering about, with his keg under his
    arm, whistling Yankee Doodle, and Washington’s Grand March; his white
    shirt, or that part of it that had been <em>flapping</em> in the wind,
    had been shockingly tithed—his pantaloons of blue, laced with gold,
    were razed into a pair of comfortable leggings—his bow and quiver were
    slung, and his broad-sword which trailed on the ground, had sought the
    centre of gravity, and taken a position between his legs, and dragging
    behind him, served as a rudder to steer him over the ‘earth’s troubled
    surface.’</p>

  <p>“‘Ha-hah-hagh———ah—————o—————oo——k, eh bien.’</p>

  <p>“Two days’ revel of this kind, had drawn from his keg all its charms;
    and in the mellowness of his heart, all his finery had vanished, and
    all of its appendages, except his umbrella, to which his heart’s
    strongest affections still clung, and with it, and under it, in
    rude dress of buckskin, he was afterwards to be seen, in all sorts
    of weather, acting the fop and the beau as well as he could, with
    his limited means. In this plight, and in this dress, with his
    umbrella always in his hand, (as the only remaining evidence of
    his <em>quondam</em> greatness,) he began in his sober moments, to
    entertain and instruct his people, by honest and simple narratives
    of things and scenes he had beheld during his tour to the East;
    but which (unfortunately for him), were to them too marvellous and
    improbable to be believed. He told the gaping multitude, that were
    constantly gathering about him, of the distance he had travelled—of
    the astonishing number of houses he had seen—of the towns and cities,
    with all their wealth and splendour—of travelling on steamboats, in
    stages, and on railroads. He described our forts, and seventy-four gun
    ships, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> he had visited—their big guns—our great bridges—our great
    council-house at Washington, and its doings—the curious and wonderful
    machines in the patent office, (which he pronounced the <em>greatest
    medicine place</em> he had seen); he described the great war parade,
    which he saw in the city of New York—the ascent of the balloon from
    Castle Garden—the numbers of the white people, the beauty of the white
    squaws; their red cheeks, and many thousands of other things, all of
    which were so much beyond their comprehension, that they ‘could not be
    true,’ and ‘he must be the very greatest liar in the whole world.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

  <p>“But he was beginning to acquire a reputation of a different kind.
    He was denominated a <em>medicine-man</em>, and one too of the most
    extraordinary character; for they deemed him far above the ordinary
    sort of human beings, whose mind could <em>invent</em> and <em>conjure</em>
    up for their amusement, such an ingenious <em>fabrication</em> of novelty
    and wonder. He steadily and unostentatiously persisted, however, in
    this way of entertaining his friends and his people, though he knew his
    standing was affected by it. He had an exhaustless theme to descant
    upon through the remainder of his life; and he seemed satisfied to
    lecture all his life, for the pleasure which it gave him.</p>

  <p>“So great was his <em>medicine</em>, however, that they began, chiefs
    and all, to look upon him as a most extraordinary being, and the
    customary honours and forms began to be applied to him, and the respect
    shewn him, that belongs to all men in the Indian country, who are
    distinguished for their <em>medicine</em> or <em>mysteries</em>. In short,
    when all became familiar with the astonishing representations that he
    made, and with the wonderful alacrity with which ‘he <em>created</em>
    them,’ he was denominated the very greatest of <em>medicine</em>; and
    not only that, but the ‘<em>lying medicine</em>.’ That he should be
    the greatest of <em>medicine</em>, and that for <em>lying, merely</em>,
    rendered him a prodigy in mysteries that commanded not only respect,
    but at length, (when he was more maturely heard and listened to)
    admiration, awe, and at last dread and terror; which altogether must
    needs conspire to rid the world of a monster, whose more than human
    talents must be cut down, to less than human measurement.</p>

  <p>“‘Wat! Monsieur Cataline, dey av not try to kill him?’</p>

  <p>“Yes, Ba’tiste, in this way the poor fellow had lived, and been for
    three years past continually relating the scenes he had beheld, in his
    tour to the ‘<em>Far East</em>;’ until his medicine became so alarmingly
    great, that they were unwilling he should live; they were disposed to
    kill him for a wizard. One of the young men of the tribe took the duty
    upon himself, and after much perplexity, hit upon the following plan,
    <em>to-wit</em>:—he had fully resolved, in conjunction with others who
    were in the conspiracy, that the medicine of Wi-jun-jon was too great
    for the ordinary mode, and that he was so great a liar that a rifle
    bullet would not kill him; while the young man was in this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>distressing
    dilemma, which lasted for some weeks, he had a dream one night, which
    solved all difficulties; and in consequence of which, he loitered about
    the store in the Fort, at the mouth of the Yellow Stone, until he could
    procure, <em>by stealth</em>, (according to the injunction of his dream,)
    the handle of an iron pot, which he supposed to possess the requisite
    virtue, and taking it into the woods, he there spent a whole day in
    straightening and filing it, to fit it into the barrel of his gun;
    after which, he made his appearance again in the Fort, with his gun
    under his robe, charged with the pot handle, and getting behind poor
    Wi-jun-jon, whilst he was talking with the Trader, placed the muzzle
    behind his head and blew out his brains!</p>

  <p>“‘Sacré vengeance! oh, mon Dieu! let me cry—I shall cry always, for
    evare—Oh he is not true, I hope? no, Monsieur, no!’</p>

  <p>“Yes, Ba’tiste, it is a fact: thus ended the days and the greatness,
    and all the pride and hopes of <span class="smcap">Wi-jun-jon</span>, the ‘<em>Pigeon’s
    Egg Head</em>,’—a warrior and a brave of the valiant Assinneboins, who
    travelled eight thousand miles to see the President, and all the great
    cities of the civilized world; and who, for telling the <em>truth</em>,
    and <em>nothing but the truth</em>, was, after he got home, disgraced and
    killed for a wizard.</p>

  <p>“‘Oh, Monsieur Cataline—I am distress—I am sick—I was hope he is not
    true—oh I am mortify. Wi-jun-jon was coot Ingin—he was my bruddare—eh
    bien—eh bien.’</p>

  <p>“Now, my friend Ba’tiste, I see you are distressed, and I regret
    exceedingly that it must be so; he was your friend and relative, and I
    myself feel sad at the poor fellow’s unhappy and luckless fate; for he
    was a handsome, an honest, and a noble Indian.”</p>

  <p>“‘C’est vrais. Monsieur, c’est vrai.’</p>

  <p>“This man’s death, Ba’tiste, has been a loss to himself, to
    his friends, and to the world, but you and I may profit by it,
    nevertheless, if we bear it in mind——</p>

  <p>“‘Oui! yes, Monsr. mais, suppose, ’tis bad wind dat blows nary way, ha?’</p>

  <p>“Yes, Ba’tiste, we may profit by his misfortune, if we choose. We may
    call it a ‘caution;’ for instance, when I come to write your book, as
    you have proposed, the fate of this poor fellow, who was relating no
    more than what he actually saw, will <em>caution</em> you against the
    <em>imprudence of telling all that you actually know</em>, and narrating
    all that you have <em>seen</em>, lest like him you sink into disgrace for
    telling the truth. You know, Ba’tiste, that there are many things to be
    seen in the kind of life that you and I have been living for some years
    past, which it would be more prudent for us to suppress than to tell.</p>

  <p>“‘Oui, Monsieur. Well, súppose, perhaps I am discourage about de book.
    Mais, we shall see, ha?’”</p>

  <p>Thus ended the last night’s gossip, and in the cool of this morning,
    we bid adieu to the quiet and stillness of this wild place, of which I
    have resolved to give a little further account before we take leave of
    it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

  <p>From the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, my delightful companion (Mr. Wood, whom
    I have before mentioned) and myself, with our Indian guide, whose
    name was O-kup-pee, tracing the beautiful shores of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters
    river, about eighty miles; crossing it at a place called “<em>Traverse
    des Sioux</em>,” and recrossing it at another point about thirty miles
    above the mouth of “<em>Terre Bleue</em>,” from whence we steered in
    a direction a little North of West for the “Côteau des Prairies,”
    leaving the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river, and crossing one of the most beautiful
    prairie countries in the world, for the distance of one hundred and
    twenty or thirty miles, which brought us to the base of the Côteau,
    where we were joined by our kind and esteemed companion Monsieur La
    Fromboise, as I have before related. This tract of country as well as
    that along the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river, is mostly covered with the richest
    soil, and furnishes an abundance of good water, which flows from a
    thousand living springs. For many miles we had the Côteau in view in
    the distance before us, which looked like a blue cloud settling down
    in the horizon; and we were scarcely sensible of the fact, when we
    had arrived at its base, from the graceful and almost imperceptible
    swells with which it commences its elevation above the country around
    it. Over these swells or terraces, gently rising one above the other,
    we travelled for the distance of forty or fifty miles, when we at
    length reached the summit; and from the base of this mound, to its
    top, a distance of forty or fifty miles, there was not a tree or bush
    to be seen in any direction, and the ground everywhere was covered
    with a green turf of grass, about five or six inches high; and we were
    assured by our Indian guide, that it descended to the West, towards
    the Missouri, with a similar inclination, and for an equal distance,
    divested of every thing save the grass that grows, and the animals that
    walk upon it.</p>

  <p>On the very top of this mound or ridge, we found the far-famed quarry
    or fountain of the Red Pipe, which is truly an anomaly in nature
    (<a href="#i_270"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 270</a>). The principal and most striking feature of this
    place, is a perpendicular wall of close-grained, compact quartz, of
    twenty-five and thirty feet in elevation, running nearly North and
    South with its face to the West, exhibiting a front of nearly two
    miles in length, when it disappears at both ends by running under the
    prairie, which becomes there a little more elevated, and probably
    covers it for many miles, both to the North and the South. The
    depression of the brow of the ridge at this place has been caused by
    the wash of a little stream, produced by several springs on the top,
    a little back from the wall; which has gradually carried away the
    super-incumbent earth, and having bared the wall for the distance of
    two miles, is now left to glide for some distance over a perfectly
    level surface of quartz rock; and then to leap from the top of the
    wall into a deep basin below, and from thence seek its course to the
    Missouri, forming the extreme source of a noted and powerful tributary,
    called the “Big Sioux.”</p>

  <p>This beautiful wall is horizontal, and stratified in several distinct
    layers of light grey, and rose or flesh-coloured quartz; and for most
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> way, both on the front of the wall, and for acres of its
    horizontal surface, highly polished or glazed, as if by ignition.</p>

  <p>At the base of this wall there is a level prairie, of half a mile in
    width, running parallel to it; in any and all parts of which, the
    Indians procure the red stone for their pipes, by digging through the
    soil and several slaty layers of the red stone, to the depth of four
    or five feet.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> From the very numerous marks of ancient and modern
    diggings or excavations, it would appear that this place has been for
    many centuries resorted to for the red stone; and from the great number
    of graves and remains of ancient fortifications in its vicinity, it
    would seem, as well as from their actual traditions, that the Indian
    tribes have long held this place in high superstitious estimation; and
    also that it has been the resort of different tribes, who have made
    their regular pilgrimages here to renew their pipes.</p>

  <p>The red pipe stone, I consider, will take its place amongst minerals,
    as an interesting subject of itself; and the “Côteau des Prairies” will
    become hereafter an important theme for geologists; not only from the
    fact that this is the only known locality of that mineral, but from
    other phenomena relating to it. The single fact of such a table of
    quartz, in horizontal strata, resting on this elevated plateau, is of
    itself (in my opinion) a very interesting subject for investigation;
    and one which calls upon the scientific world for a correct theory with
    regard to the time when, and the manner in which, this formation was
    produced. That it is of a secondary character, and of a sedimentary
    deposit, seems evident; and that it has withstood the force of the
    diluvial current, while the great valley of the Missouri, from this
    very wall of rocks to the Rocky Mountains, has been excavated, and
    its debris carried to the ocean, there is also not a shadow of doubt;
    which opinion I confidently advance on the authority of the following
    remarkable facts:</p>

  <p>At the base of the wall, and within a few rods of it, and on the very
    ground where the Indians dig for the red stone, rests a group of five
    stupendous boulders of gneiss, leaning against each other; the smallest
    of which is twelve or fifteen feet, and the largest twenty-five feet
    in diameter, altogether weighing, unquestionably, several hundred
    tons. These blocks are composed chiefly of felspar and mica, of an
    exceedingly coarse grain (the felspar often occurring in crystals
    of an inch in diameter). The surface of these boulders is in every
    part covered with a grey moss, which gives them an extremely ancient
    and venerable appearance, and their sides and angles are rounded by
    attrition, to the shape and character of most other erratic stones,
    which are found throughout the country. It is under these blocks that
    the two holes, or ovens are seen, in which, according to the Indian
    superstition, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>the two old women, the guardian spirits of the place,
    reside; of whom I have before spoken.</p>

  <p>That these five immense blocks, of precisely the same character, and
    differing materially from all other specimens of boulders which I have
    seen in the great vallies of the Mississippi and Missouri, should have
    been hurled some hundreds of miles from their native bed, and lodged in
    so singular a group on this elevated ridge, is truly matter of surprise
    for the scientific world, as well as for the poor Indian, whose
    superstitious veneration of them is such, that not a spear of grass is
    broken or bent by his feet, within three or four rods of them, where
    he stops, and in humble supplication, by throwing plugs of tobacco
    to them, solicits permission to dig and carry away the red stone for
    his pipes. The surface of these boulders are in every part entire and
    unscratched by anything; wearing the moss everywhere unbroken, except
    where I applied the hammer, to obtain some small specimens, which I
    shall bring away with me.</p>

  <p>The fact alone, that these blocks differ in character from all other
    specimens which I have seen in my travels, amongst the thousands of
    boulders which are strewed over the great valley of the Missouri and
    Mississippi, from the Yellow Stone almost to the Gulf of Mexico, raises
    in my mind an unanswerable question, as regards the location of their
    native bed, and the means by which they have reached their isolated
    position; like five brothers, leaning against and supporting each
    other, without the existence of another boulder within many miles of
    them. There are thousands and tens of thousands of boulders scattered
    over the prairies, at the base of the Côteau on either side; and so
    throughout the valley of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters and Mississippi, which are also
    subjects of very great interest and importance to science, inasmuch as
    they present to the world, a vast variety of characters; and each one,
    though strayed away from its original position, bears incontestable
    proof of the character of its native bed. The tract of country lying
    between the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river and the Côteau, over which we passed,
    presents innumerable specimens of this kind; and near the base of
    the Côteau they are strewed over the prairie in countless numbers,
    presenting almost an incredible variety of rich, and beautiful colours;
    and undoubtedly traceable, (if they can be traced), to separate and
    distinct beds.</p>

  <p>Amongst these beautiful groups, it was sometimes a very easy matter
    to sit on my horse and count within my sight, some twenty or thirty
    different varieties, of quartz and granite, in rounded boulders, of
    every hue and colour, from snow white to intense red, and yellow,
    and blue, and almost to a jet black; each one well characterized and
    evidently from a distinct quarry. With the beautiful hues and almost
    endless characters of these blocks, I became completely surprised and
    charmed; and I resolved to procure specimens of every variety, which
    I did with success, by dismounting from my horse, and breaking small
    bits from them with my hammer; until I had something like an hundred
    different varieties, containing all the tints and colours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> of a
    painter’s palette. These, I at length threw away, as I had on several
    former occasions, other minerals and fossils, which I had collected and
    lugged along from day to day, and sometimes from week to week.</p>

  <p>Whether these varieties of quartz and granite can all be traced to
    their native beds, or whether they all have origins at this time
    exposed above the earth’s surface, are equally matters of much doubt in
    my mind. I believe that the geologist may take the different varieties,
    which he may gather at the base of the Côteau in one hour, and travel
    the Continent of North America all over without being enabled to put
    them all in place; coming at last to the unavoidable conclusion, that
    numerous chains or beds of primitive rocks have reared their heads on
    this Continent, the summits of which have been swept away by the force
    of diluvial currents, and their fragments jostled together and strewed
    about, like foreigners in a strange land, over the great vallies of the
    Mississippi and Missouri, where they will ever remain, and be gazed
    upon by the traveller, as the only remaining evidence of their native
    beds, which have again submerged or been covered with diluvial deposits.</p>

  <p>There seems not to be, either on the Côteau or in the great vallies on
    either side, so far as I have travelled, any slaty or other formation
    exposed above the surface on which grooves or scratches can be seen, to
    establish the direction of the diluvial currents in those regions; yet
    I think the fact is pretty clearly established by the general shapes of
    the vallies, and the courses of the mountain ridges which wall them in
    on their sides.</p>

  <p>The Côteau des Prairies is the dividing ridge between the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters
    and Missouri rivers; its southern termination or slope is about in the
    latitude of the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, and it stands equi-distant between
    the two rivers; its general course bearing two or three degrees West of
    North for the distance of two or three hundred miles, when it gradually
    slopes again to the North, throwing out from its base the head-waters
    and tributaries of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, on the East. The Red River, and
    other streams, which empty into Hudson’s Bay, on the North; La Riviere
    Jaque and several other tributaries to the Missouri, on the West; and
    the Red Cedar, the Ioway and the Des Moines, on the South.</p>

  <p>This wonderful feature, which is several hundred miles in length, and
    varying from fifty to a hundred in width, is, perhaps, the noblest
    mound of its kind in the world; it gradually and gracefully rises on
    each side, by swell after swell, without tree, or bush or rock (save
    what are to be seen in the vicinity of the Pipe Stone Quarry), and
    everywhere covered with green grass, affording the traveller, from its
    highest elevations, the most unbounded and sublime views——of nothing at
    all——save the blue and boundless ocean of prairies that lie beneath and
    all around him, vanishing into azure in the distance without a speck or
    spot to break their softness.</p>

  <p>The direction of this ridge, I consider, pretty clearly establishes the
    course of the diluvial current in this region, and the erratic stones
    which are distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> along its base, I attribute to an origin several
    hundred miles North West from the Côteau. I have not myself traced
    the Côteau to its highest points, nor to its Northern extremity; but
    it has been a subject, on which I have closely questioned a number of
    traders, who have traversed every mile of it with their carts, and from
    thence to Lake Winnepeg on the North, who uniformly tell me, that there
    is no range of primitive rocks to be crossed in travelling the whole
    distance, which is one connected and continuous prairie.</p>

  <p>The top and sides of the Côteau are everywhere strewed over the surface
    with granitic sand and pebbles, which, together with the fact of the
    five boulders resting at the Pipe Stone Quarry, shew clearly that every
    part of the ridge has been subject to the action of these currents,
    which could not have run counter to it, without having disfigured or
    deranged its beautiful symmetry.</p>

  <p>The glazed or polished surface of the quartz rocks at the Pipe Stone
    Quarry, I consider a very interesting subject, and one which will
    excite hereafter a variety of theories, as to the manner in which it
    has been produced, and the causes which have led to such singular
    results. The quartz is of a close grain, and exceedingly hard,
    eliciting the most brilliant spark from steel; and in most places,
    where exposed to the sun and the air, has a high polish on its
    surface, entirely beyond any results which could have been produced by
    diluvial action, being perfectly glazed as if by ignition. I was not
    sufficiently particular in my examinations to ascertain whether any
    parts of the surface of these rocks under the ground, and not exposed
    to the action of the air, were thus affected, which would afford an
    important argument in forming a correct theory with regard to it; and
    it may also be a fact of similar importance, that this polish does not
    extend over the whole wall or area; but is distributed over it in parts
    and sections, often disappearing suddenly, and reappearing again, even
    where the character and exposure of the rock is the same and unbroken.
    In general, the parts and points most projecting and exposed, bear
    the highest polish, which would naturally be the case whether it was
    produced by ignition, or by the action of the air and sun. It would
    seem almost an impossibility, that the air passing these projections
    for a series of centuries, could have produced so high a polish on so
    hard a substance; and it seems equally unaccountable, that this effect
    could have been produced in the other way, in the total absence of all
    igneous matter.</p>

  <p>I have broken off specimens and brought them home, which certainly bear
    as high a polish and lustre on the surface, as a piece of melted glass;
    and then as these rocks have undoubtedly been formed where they now
    lie, it must be admitted, that this strange effect on their surface has
    been produced either by the action of the air and sun, or by igneous
    influence; and if by the latter course, there is no other conclusion we
    can come to, than that these results are volcanic; that this wall has
    once formed the side of a crater, and that the Pipe Stone, laving in
    horizontal strata, is formed of the lava which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> issued from it. I
    am strongly inclined to believe, however, that the former supposition
    is the correct one; and that the Pipe Stone, which differs from all
    known specimens of lava, is a new variety of <em>steatite</em>, and will
    be found to be a subject of great interest and one worthy of a careful
    analysis.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

  <p>With such notes and such memorandums on this shorn land, whose quiet
    and silence are only broken by the winds and the thunders of Heaven, I
    close my note-book, and we this morning saddle our horses; and after
    wending our way to the “Thunders’ Nest” and the “Stone-man Medicine,”
    we shall descend into the valley of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, and from that to
    the regions of civilization; from whence, if I can get there, you will
    hear of me again. Adieu.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be seen by this, that I am again wending my way towards home.
    Our neat little “dug out,” by the aid of our paddles, has at length
    brought my travelling companion and myself in safety to this place,
    where we found the river, the shores, and the plains contiguous, alive
    and vivid with plumes, with spears, and war-clubs of the yelling red men.</p>

  <p>We had heard that the whole nation of Sacs and Foxes were to meet
    Governor Dodge here in treaty at this time, and nerve was given
    liberally to our paddles, which had brought us from Traverse de Sioux,
    on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river; and we reached here luckily in time to see the
    parades and forms of a savage community, transferring the rights and
    immunities of their natural soil, to the insatiable grasp of pale faced
    voracity.</p>

  <p>After having glutted our curiosity at the fountain of the Red Pipe, our
    horses brought us to the base of the Côteau, and then over the extended
    plain that lies between that and the Traverse de Sioux, on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Peters with about five days’ travel.</p>

  <p>In this distance we passed some of the loveliest prairie country in the
    world, and I made a number of sketches—“<em>Laque du Cygne</em>, Swan
    Lake,” (<a href="#i_276"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 276</a>), was a peculiar and lovely scene, extending
    for many miles, and filled with innumerable small islands covered
    with a profusion of rich forest trees. <a href="#i_277"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 277</a>, exhibits
    the Indian mode of taking muskrats, which dwell in immense numbers in
    these northern prairies, and build their burrows in shoal water, of the
    stalks of the wild rice. They are built up something of the size and
    form of haycocks, having a dry chamber in the top, where the animal
    sleeps above water, passing in and out through a hole beneath the
    water’s surface. The skins of these animals are sought by the Traders,
    for their fur, and they constitute the staple of all these regions,
    being caught in immense numbers by the Indians, and vended to the Fur
    Traders. The mode of taking them is seen in the drawing; the women,
    children and dogs attend to the little encampments, while the men wade
    to their houses or burrows, and one strikes on the backs of them, as
    the other takes the inhabitants in a rapid manner with a spear, while
    they are escaping from them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

  <p><a href="#i_278"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 278</a>, is a party of Sioux, in bark canoes (purchased of
    the Chippeways), gathering the wild rice, which grows in immense fields
    around the shores of the rivers and lakes of these northern regions,
    and used by the Indians as an useful article of food. The mode of
    gathering it is curious, and as seen in the drawing—one woman paddles
    the canoe, whilst another, with a stick in each hand, bends the rice
    over the canoe with one, and strikes it with the other, which shells it
    into the canoe, which is constantly moving along until it is filled.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_279"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 279</a>, is a representation of one of the many lovely
    prairie scenes we passed on the banks of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters river, near the
    Traverse de Sioux.</p>

  <p>Whilst traversing this beautiful region of country, we passed the bands
    of Sioux, who had made us so much trouble on our way to the Red Pipe,
    but met with no further molestation.</p>

  <p>At the Traverse de Sioux, our horses were left, and we committed our
    bodies and little travelling conveniences to the narrow compass of
    a modest canoe, that must most evidently have been dug out from the
    <em>wrong side of the log</em>—that required <em>us</em> and everything in
    it, to be exactly in the bottom—and then, to look straight forward,
    and speak from the <em>middle</em> of our <em>mouths</em>, or it was
    “<em>t’other side up</em>” in an instant. In this way embarked, with our
    paddles used as balance poles and propellers (after drilling awhile in
    shoal water till we could “get the hang of it”), we started off, upon
    the bosom of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peters, for the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony. <span class="gesperrtstar">* * * * * *</span>
    Sans accident we arrived, at ten o’clock at night of the second day—and
    sans steamer (which we were in hopes to meet), we were obliged to trust
    to our little tremulous craft to carry us through the windings of the
    mighty Mississippi and Lake Pepin, to Prairie du Chien, a distance of
    400 miles, which I had travelled last summer in the same manner.</p>

  <p>“Oh the drudgery and toil of paddling our little canoe from this to
    Prairie du Chien, we never can do it, Catlin.”</p>

  <p>“Ah well, never mind, my dear fellow—we <em>must</em> ‘go it’—there is
    no other way. But think of the pleasure of such a trip, ha? Our guns
    and our fishing-tackle will we have in good order, and be masters of
    our own boat—we can shove it into every nook and crevice; explore the
    caves in the rocks; ascend ‘<em>Mount Strombolo</em>,’ and linger along
    the pebbly shores of Lake Pepin, to our hearts’ content.” “Well, I am
    perfectly agreed; that’s fine, by Jupiter, that’s what I shall relish
    exactly; we will have our own fun, and a truce to the labour and time;
    let’s haste and be off.” So we catered for our voyage, shook hands
    with our friends, and were again balancing our skittish bark upon
    the green waters of the Mississippi. We encamped (as I had done the
    summer before), along its lonely banks, whose only music is the echoing
    war-song that rises from the glimmering camp-fire of the retiring
    savage, or the cries of the famishing wolf that sits and bitterly weeps
    out in tremulous tones, his impatience for the crumbs that are to fall
    to his lot.</p>

  <p>Oh! but we enjoyed those moments, (did we not, Wood? I would ask you,
    in any part of the world, where circumstances shall throw this in your
    way) those nights of our voyage, which ended days of peril and fatigue;
    when our larder was full, when our coffee was good, our mats spread,
    and our musquito bars over us, which admitted the cool and freshness of
    night, but screened the dew, and bade defiance to the buzzing thousands
    of sharp-billed, winged torturers that were kicking and thumping for
    admission. I speak now of <em>fair weather</em>, not of the nights of
    lightning and of rain! We’ll pass them over. We had all kinds though,
    and as we loitered ten days on our way, we examined and experimented
    on many things for the benefit of mankind. We drew into our larder
    (in addition to bass and wild fowls), clams, snails, frogs, and
    rattlesnakes; the latter of which, when properly dressed and broiled,
    we found to be the most delicious food of the land.</p>

  <p>We were stranded upon the Eastern shore of Lake Pepin, where headwinds
    held us three days; and, like solitary Malays or Zealand penguins, we
    stalked along and about its pebbly shores till we were tired, before
    we could, with security, lay our little trough upon its troubled
    surface. When liberated from its wind-bound shores, we busily plied
    our paddles, and nimbly sped our way, until we were landed at the
    fort of “Mount Strombolo,” (as the soldiers call it), but properly
    denominated, in French, <i lang="fr">La Montaigne que tromps a l’eau</i>. We
    ascended it without much trouble; and enjoyed from its top, one of the
    most magnificent panoramic views that the Western world can furnish;
    and I would recommend to the tourist who has time to stop for an hour
    or two, to go to its summit, and enjoy with rapture, the splendour of
    the scene that lies near and in distance about him. This mountain, or
    rather pyramid, is an anomaly in the country, rising as it does, about
    seven hundred feet from the water, and washed at its base, all around,
    by the river; which divides and runs on each side of it. It is composed
    chiefly of rock, and all its strata correspond exactly with those of
    the projecting promontories on either side of the river. We at length
    arrived safe at Prairie du Chien; which was also sans steamer. We were
    moored again, thirty miles below, at the beautiful banks and bluffs of
    Cassville; which, too, was <em>sans steamer</em>—we dipped our paddles
    again ——— ——— ——— and ...</p>

  <p>We are now six hundred miles below the Fall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, where
    steamers daily pass; and we feel, of course, at home. I spoke of the
    <em>Treaty</em>. We were just in time, and beheld its conclusion. It
    was signed yesterday; and this day, of course, is one of revel and
    amusements—shows of war-parades and dances. The whole of the Sacs and
    Foxes are gathered here, and their appearance is very thrilling, and
    at the same time pleasing. These people have sold so much of their
    land lately, that they have the luxuries of life to a considerable
    degree, and may be considered rich; consequently they look elated and
    happy, carrying themselves much above the humbled manner of most of the
    semi-civilized tribes, whose heads are hanging and drooping in poverty
    and despair.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

  <p>In a former epistle, I mentioned the interview which I had with
    Kee-o-kuk, and the leading men and women of his tribe, when I painted a
    number of their portraits and amusements as follow:</p>

  <p><em>Kee-o-kuk</em> (the running fox, <a href="#i_280"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 280</a>), is the present
    chief of the tribe, a dignified and proud man, with a good share of
    talent, and vanity enough to force into action all the wit and judgment
    he possesses, in order to command the attention and respect of the
    world. At the close of the “Black Hawk War” in 1833, which had been
    waged with disastrous effects along the frontier, by a Sac chief of
    that name; <em>Kee-o-kuk</em> was acknowledged chief of the Sacs and
    Foxes by General Scott, who held a Treaty with them at Rock Island. His
    appointment as chief, was in consequence of the friendly position he
    had taken during the war, holding two-thirds of the warriors neutral,
    which was no doubt the cause of the sudden and successful termination
    of the war, and the means of saving much bloodshed. Black Hawk and his
    two sons, as well as his principal advisers and warriors, were brought
    into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis in chains, and <em>Kee-o-kuk</em> appointed chief with
    the assent of the tribe. In his portrait I have represented him in
    the costume, precisely, in which he was dressed when he stood for it,
    with his shield on his arm, and his staff (insignia of office) in his
    left hand. There is no Indian chief on the frontier better known at
    this time, or more highly appreciated for his eloquence, as a public
    speaker, than Kee-o-kuk; as he has repeatedly visited Washington and
    others of our Atlantic towns, and made his speeches before thousands,
    when he has been contending for his people’s rights, in their
    stipulations with the United States Government, for the sale of their lands.</p>

  <p>As so much is known of this man, amongst the citizens of the United
    States, there is scarcely need of my saying much more of him to
    them; but for those who know less of him, I shall say more anon.
    <a href="#i_281"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 281</a>, is a portrait of the wife of <em>Kee-o-kuk</em>, and
    <a href="#i_282"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 282</a>, of his favourite son, whom he intends to be his
    successor. These portraits are both painted, also, in the costumes
    precisely in which they were dressed. This woman was the favourite
    one, (I think) of seven, whom he had living, (<em>apparently</em> quite
    comfortably and peaceably,) in his wigwam, where General Street and
    I visited him in his village on the Des Moines river. And, although
    she was the oldest of the “lot,” she seemed to be the favourite one
    on this occasion—the only one that could be painted; on account, I
    believe, of her being the mother of his favourite son. Her dress, which
    was of civilized stuffs, was fashioned and ornamented by herself, and
    was truly a most splendid affair; the upper part of it being almost
    literally covered with silver broaches.</p>

  <p>The Sacs and Foxes, who were once two separate tribes, but with a
    language very similar, have, at some period not very remote, united
    into one, and are now an inseparable people, and go by the familiar
    appellation of the amalgam name of “Sacs and Foxes.”</p>

  <p>These people, as will be seen in their portraits, shave and ornament
    their heads, like the Osages and Pawnees, of whom I have spoken
    heretofore; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>and are amongst the number of tribes who have
    relinquished their immense tracts of lands, and recently retired West
    of the Mississippi river. Their numbers at present are not more than
    five or six thousand, yet they are a warlike and powerful tribe.</p>

  <p><em>Muk-a-tah-mish-o-kah-kaik</em> (the black hawk, <a href="#i_283"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 283</a>)
    is the man to whom I have above alluded, as the leader of the “Black
    Hawk war,” who was defeated by General Atkinson, and held a prisoner
    of war, and sent through Washington and other Eastern cities, with a
    number of others, to be gazed at.</p>

  <p>This man, whose name has carried a sort of terror through the country
    where it has been sounded, has been distinguished as a speaker or
    councellor rather than as a warrior; and I believe it has been pretty
    generally admitted, that “<em>Nah-pope</em>” and the “Prophet” were, in
    fact, the instigators of the war; and either of them with much higher
    claims for the name of warrior than Black Hawk ever had.</p>

  <p>When I painted this chief, he was dressed in a plain suit of buckskin,
    with strings of wampum in his ears and on his neck, and held in his
    hand, his medicine-bag, which was the skin of a black hawk, from which
    he had taken his name, and the tail of which made him a fan, which he
    was almost constantly using.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_283"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 284</a>, is the eldest son of Black Hawk,
    <em>Nah-se-us-kuk</em> (the whirling thunder), a very handsome young
    warrior, and one of the finest-looking Indians I ever saw. There is a
    strong party in the tribe that is anxious to put this young man up;
    and I think it more than likely, that <em>Kee-o-kuk</em> as chief may
    fall ere long by his hand, or by some of the tribe, who are anxious to
    reinstate the family of Black Hawk.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_285"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 285</a>, <em>Wah-pe-kee-suck</em> (the white cloud), called
    “the Prophet,” is a very distinguished man, and one of the principal
    and leading men of the Black Hawk party, and studying favour with the
    whites, as will be seen by the manner in which he was allowing his hair
    to grow out.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_285"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 286</a>, <em>Wee-sheet</em> (the sturgeon’s head), this man
    held a spear in his hand when he was being painted, with which he
    assured me he killed four white men during the war; though I have some
    doubts of the fact.</p>

  <p><em>Ah-mou-a</em> (the whale, <a href="#i_287"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 287</a>, and his wife,
    <a href="#i_288"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 288</a>), are also fair specimens of this tribe. Her name is
    Wa-quo-the-qua (the buck’s wife, or female deer), and she was wrapped
    in a mackinaw blanket, whilst he was curiously dressed, and held his
    war-club in his hand.</p>

  <p><em>Pash-ee-pa-ho</em> (the little stabbing chief, <a href="#i_289"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 289</a>), a
    very old man, holding his shield, staff and pipe in his hands; has long
    been the head civil chief of this tribe; but, as is generally the case
    in very old age, he has resigned the office to those who are younger
    and better qualified to do the duties of it.</p>

  <p>Besides the above-mentioned personages, I painted also the following
    portraits, which are now in my Collection.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

  <p><em>I-o-way</em> (the Ioway), one of Black Hawk’s principal warriors; his
    body curiously ornamented with his “war-paint;” <em>Pam-a-ho</em> (the
    swimmer), one of Black Hawk’s warriors; <em>No-kuk-qua</em> (the bear’s
    fat); <em>Pash-ee-pa-ho</em> (the little stabbing chief, the younger),
    one of Black Hawk’s braves; <em>Wah-pa-ko-las-kuk</em> (the bear’s
    track); <em>Wa-saw-me-saw</em> (the roaring thunder), youngest son of
    Black Hawk; painted while prisoner of war.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_290"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 290</a>, <em>Kee-o-kuk</em>, on horseback. After I had painted
    the portrait of this vain man at full length, and which I have already
    introduced, he had the vanity to say to me, that he made a fine
    appearance on horseback, and that he wished me to paint him thus. So
    I prepared my canvass in the door of the hospital which I occupied,
    in the dragoon cantonment; and he flourished about for a considerable
    part of the day in front of me, until the picture was completed. The
    horse that he rode was the best animal on the frontier; a fine blooded
    horse, for which he gave the price of 300 dollars, a thing that he was
    quite able to, who had the distribution of 50,000 dollars annuities,
    annually, amongst his people. He made a great display on this day, and
    hundreds of the dragoons and officers were about him, and looking on
    during the operation. His horse was beautifully caparisoned, and his
    scalps were carried attached to the bridle-bits.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

  <p>The dances and other amusements amongst this tribe are exceedingly
    spirited and pleasing; and I have made sketches of a number of them,
    which I briefly introduce here, and leave them for further comments at
    a future time, provided I ever get leisure and space to enable me to do
    it.</p>

  <p>The <em>slave-dance</em> (<a href="#i_291"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 291</a>), is a picturesque scene,
    and the custom in which it is founded a very curious one. This tribe
    has a society which they call the “<em>slaves</em>,” composed of a number
    of the young men of the best families in the tribe, who volunteer to
    be slaves for the term of two years, and subject to perform any menial
    service that the chief may order, no matter how humiliating or how
    degrading it may be; by which, after serving their two years, they are
    exempt for the rest of their lives, on war-parties or other excursions,
    or wherever they may be—from all labour or degrading occupations, such
    as cooking, making fires, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These young men elect one from their numbers to be their master, and
    all agree to obey his command whatever it may be, and which is given to
    him by one of the chiefs of the tribe. On a certain day or season of
    the year, they have to themselves a great feast, and preparatory to it
    the above-mentioned dance.</p>

  <p><em>Smoking horses</em> (<a href="#i_292"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 292</a>), is another of the peculiar
    and very curious customs of this tribe. When General Street and I,
    arrived at Kee-o-kuks village, we were just in time to see this amusing
    scene, on the prairie a little back of his village. The Foxes, who were
    making up a war-party to go against the Sioux, and had not suitable
    horses enough by twenty, had sent word to the Sacs, the day before
    (according to an ancient custom), that they were coming on that day,
    at a certain hour, to “smoke” that number of horses, and they must
    not fail to have them ready. On that day, and at the hour, the twenty
    young men who were beggars for horses, were on the spot, and seated
    themselves on the ground in a circle, where they went to smoking. The
    villagers flocked around them in a dense crowd, and soon after appeared
    on the prairie, at half a mile distance, an equal number of young men
    of the Sac tribe, who had agreed, each to give a horse, and who were
    then galloping them about at full speed; and, gradually, as they went
    around in a circuit, coming in nearer to the centre, until they were
    at last close around the ring of young fellows seated on the ground.
    Whilst dashing about thus, each one, with a heavy whip in his hand, as
    he came within reach of the group on the ground, selected the one to
    whom he decided to present his horse, and as he passed him, gave him
    the most tremendous cut with his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>lash, over his naked shoulders; and
    as he darted around again he plied the whip as before, and again and
    again, with a violent “crack!” until the blood could be seen trickling
    down over his naked shoulders, upon which he instantly dismounted,
    and placed the bridle and whip in his hands, saying, “here, you are a
    beggar—I present you a horse, but you will carry my mark on your back.”
    In this manner, they were all in a little time “<em>whipped up</em>,” and
    each had a good horse to ride home, and into battle. His necessity was
    such, that he could afford to take the stripes and the scars as the
    price of the horse, and the giver could afford to make the present for
    the satisfaction of putting his mark upon the other, and of boasting of
    his liberality, which he has always a right to do, when going into the
    dance, or on other important occasions.</p>

  <p>The <em>Begging Dance</em> (<a href="#i_293"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 293</a>), is a frequent amusement,
    and one that has been practiced with some considerable success at
    this time, whilst there have been so many distinguished and liberal
    visitors here. It is got up by a number of desperate and long-winded
    fellows, who will dance and yell their visitors into liberality; or,
    if necessary, laugh them into it, by their strange antics, singing a
    song of importunity, and extending their hands for presents, which they
    allege are to gladden the hearts of the poor, and ensure a blessing to
    the giver.</p>

  <p>The Sacs and Foxes, like all other Indians, are fond of living along
    the banks of rivers and streams; and like all others, are expert
    swimmers and skilful canoemen.</p>

  <p>Their canoes, like those of the Sioux and many other tribes, are dug
    out from a log, and generally made extremely light; and they dart them
    through the coves and along the shores of the rivers, with astonishing
    quickness. I was often amused at their freaks in their canoes,
    whilst travelling; and I was induced to make a sketch of one which I
    frequently witnessed, that of sailing with the aid of their blankets,
    which the men carry; and when the wind is fair, stand in the bow of the
    canoe and hold by two corners, with the other two under the foot or
    tied to the leg (<a href="#i_294"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 294</a>); while the women sit in the other
    end of the canoe, and steer it with their paddles.</p>

  <p>The <em>Discovery Dance</em> (<a href="#i_295"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 295</a>), has been given here,
    amongst various others, and pleased the bystanders very much; it was
    exceedingly droll and picturesque, and acted out with a great deal of
    pantomimic effect—without music, or any other noise than the patting
    of their feet, which all came simultaneously on the ground, in perfect
    time, whilst they were dancing forward two or four at a time, in a
    skulking posture, overlooking the country, and professing to announce
    the approach of animals or enemies which they have discovered, by
    giving the signals back to the leader of the dance.</p>

  <p><em>Dance to the Berdashe</em> (<a href="#i_296"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 296</a>), is a very funny and
    amusing scene, which happens once a year or oftener, as they choose,
    when a feast is given to the “<em>Berdashe</em>,” as he is called in
    French, (or <em>I-coo-coo-a</em>, in their own language), who is a man
    dressed in woman’s clothes, as he is known to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>be all his
    life, and for extraordinary privileges which he is known to possess,
    he is driven to the most servile and degrading duties, which he is not
    allowed to escape; and he being the only one of the tribe submitting
    to this disgraceful degradation, is looked upon as <em>medicine</em>
    and sacred, and a feast is given to him annually; and initiatory to
    it, a dance by those few young men of the tribe who can, as in the
    sketch, dance forward and publicly make their boast (without the denial
    of the Berdashe), that Ahg-whi-ee-choos-cum-me hi-anh-dwax-cumme-ke
    on-daig-nun-ehow ixt. Che-ne-a’hkt ah-pex-ian I-coo-coo-a wi-an-gurotst

  <p>Such, and such only, are allowed to enter the dance and partake of
    the feast, and as there are but a precious few in the tribe who have
    legitimately gained this singular privilege, or willing to make a
    public confession of it, it will be seen that the society consists of
    quite a limited number of “odd fellows.”</p>

  <p>This is one of the most unaccountable and disgusting customs, that I
    have ever met in the Indian country, and so far as I have been able
    to learn, belongs only to the Sioux and Sacs and Foxes—perhaps it is
    practiced by other tribes, but I did not meet with it; and for further
    account of it I am constrained to refer the reader to the country where
    it is practiced, and where I should wish that it might be extinguished
    before it be more fully recorded.</p>

  <p>Dance to the <em>Medicine of the Brave</em> (<a href="#i_297"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 297</a>). This
    is a custom well worth recording, for the beautiful moral which is
    contained in it. In this plate is represented a party of Sac warriors
    who have returned victorious from battle, with scalps they have taken
    from their enemies, but having lost one of their party, they appear and
    dance in front of his wigwam, fifteen days in succession, about an hour
    on each day, when the widow hangs his <em>medicine-bag</em> on a green
    bush which she erects before her door, under which she sits and cries,
    whilst the warriors dance and brandish the scalps they have taken, and
    at the same time recount the deeds of bravery of their deceased comrade
    in arms, whilst they are throwing presents to the widow to heal her
    grief and afford her the means of a living.</p>

  <p>The Sacs and Foxes are already drawing an annuity of 27,000 dollars,
    for thirty years to come, in cash; and by the present Treaty just
    concluded, that amount will be enlarged to 37,000 dollars per annum.
    This Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, held at Rock Island, was for
    the purchase of a tract of land of 256,000 acres, lying on the Ioway
    river, West of the Mississippi, a reserve which was made in the tract
    of land conveyed to the Government by Treaty after the Sac war, and
    known as the “Black Hawk purchase.” The Treaty has been completed by
    Governor Dodge, by stipulating on the part of Government to pay them
    seventy-five cents per acre for the reserve, (amounting to 192,000
    dollars), in the manner and form following:—</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand dollars to be paid in specie in June next, at the
    Treaty-ground; and ten thousand dollars annually, for ten years to
    come, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> same place, and in the same manner; and the remaining
    sixty-two thousand, in the payment of their debts, and some little
    donations to widows and half-breed children. The American Fur Company
    was their principal creditor, whose account for goods advanced
    on credit, they admitted, to the amount of nearly fifty thousand
    dollars. It was stipulated by an article in the Treaty that one half
    of these demands should be paid in cash as soon as the Treaty should
    be ratified—and that five thousand dollars should be appropriated
    annually, for their liquidation, until they were paid off.</p>

  <p>It was proposed by Kee-o-kuk in his speech (and it is a fact worthy of
    being known, for such has been the proposition in every Indian Treaty
    that I ever attended), that the first preparatory stipulation on the
    part of Government, should be to pay the requisite sum of money to
    satisfy all their creditors, who were then present, and whose accounts
    were handed in, acknowledged and admitted.</p>

  <p>The price paid for this tract of land is a liberal one, comparatively
    speaking, for the usual price heretofore paid for Indian lands, has
    been one and a half or three quarter cents, (instead of seventy-five
    cents) per acre, for land which Government has since sold out for ten
    shillings.</p>

  <p>Even one dollar per acre would not have been too much to have paid
    for this tract, for every acre of it can be sold in one year, for ten
    shillings per acre, to actual settlers, so desirable and so fertile is
    the tract of country purchased. These very people sold to Government
    a great part of the rich states of Illinois and Missouri, at the low
    rates above-mentioned; and this small tract being the last that they
    can ever part with, without throwing themselves back upon their natural
    enemies, it was no more than right that Government should deal with
    them, as they have done, liberally.</p>

  <p>As an evidence of the immediate value of that tract of land to
    Government, and, as a striking instance of the overwhelming torrent of
    emigration, to the “Far West,” I will relate the following occurrence
    which took place at the close of the Treaty:—After the Treaty was
    signed and witnessed, Governor Dodge addressed a few very judicious
    and admonitory sentences to the chiefs and braves, which he finished
    by requesting them to move their families, and all their property from
    this tract, within one month, which time he would allow them, to make
    room for the whites.</p>

  <p>Considerable excitement, was created among the chiefs and braves, by
    this suggestion, and a hearty laugh ensued, the cause of which was soon
    after explained by one of them in the following manner:—</p>

  <p>“My father, we have to laugh—we require no time to move—we have all
    left the lands already, and sold our wigwams to Chemokemons (white
    men)—some for one hundred, and some for two hundred dollars, before
    we came to this Treaty. There are already four hundred Chemokemons on
    the land, and several hundred more on their way moving in; and three
    days before we came away, one Chemokemon sold his wigwam to another
    Chemokemon for two thousand dollars, to build a great town.”</p>

  <div class="plate mt2"><i>168</i></div>
  <figure id="i_297">

    <figcaption>297</figcaption>
  </figure >

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

  <p>In this wise is this fair land filling up, one hundred miles or more
    West of the Mississippi—not with barbarians, but with people from the
    East, enlightened and intelligent—with industry and perseverance that
    will soon reap from the soil all the luxuries, and add to the surface,
    all the taste and comforts of Eastern refinement.</p>

  <p>The Treaty itself, in all its forms, was a scene of interest, and
    <em>Kee-o-kuk</em> was the principal speaker on the occasion, being
    recognized as the head chief of the tribe. He is a very subtle and
    dignified man, and well fitted to wield the destinies of his nation.
    The poor dethroned monarch, old Black Hawk, was present, and looked an
    object of pity. With an old frock coat and brown hat on, and a cane in
    his hand, he stood the whole time outside of the group, and in dumb
    and dismal silence, with his sons by the side of him, and also his
    <em>quondam</em>, aide-de-camp, Nah-pope, and the prophet. They were
    not allowed to speak, nor even to sign the Treaty. <em>Nah-pope</em>
    rose, however, and commenced a very earnest speech on the subject
    of <em>temperance</em>! but Governor Dodge ordered him to sit down,
    (as being out of order), which probably saved him from a much more
    <em>peremptory command</em> from <em>Kee-o-kuk</em>, who was rising at
    that moment, with looks on his face that the Devil himself might have
    shrunk from. This Letter I must end here, observing, before I say
    adieu, that I have been catering for the public during this summer
    at a <em>difficult</em> (and almost <em>cruel</em>) rate; and if, in my
    over-exertions to grasp at material for their future entertainment, the
    cold hand of winter should be prematurely laid upon me and my works in
    this Northern region, the world, I am sure, will be disposed to pity,
    rather than censure me for my delay.</p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> About two years after the above was written, and the
      portrait painted, and whilst I was giving Lectures on the Customs of
      the Indians, in the Stuyvesant Institute in New York, Kee-o-kuk and
      his wife and son, with twenty more of the chiefs and warriors of his
      tribe, visited the City of New York on their way to Washington City,
      and were present one evening at my Lecture, amidst an audience of 1500
      persons. During the Lecture, I placed a succession of portraits on my
      easel before the audience, and they were successively recognized by
      the Indians as they were shewn; and at last I placed this portrait
      of Kee-o-kuk before them, when they all sprung up and hailed it with
      a piercing yell. After the noise had subsided, Kee-o-kuk arose, and
      addressed the audience in these words:—“My friends, I hope you will
      pardon my men for making so much noise, as they were very much excited
      by seeing me on my favourite war-horse, which they all recognized in a
      moment.”

      <p>I had the satisfaction then of saying to the audience, that this was
        very gratifying to me, inasmuch as many persons had questioned the
        correctness of the picture of the horse; and some had said in my
        Exhibition Room, “that it was an imposition—that no Indian on the
        frontier rode so good a horse.” This was explained to Kee-o-kuk by the
        interpreter, when he arose again quite indignant at the thought that
        any one should doubt its correctness, and assured the audience, “that
        his men, a number of whom never had heard that the picture was painted,
        knew the horse the moment it was presented; and further, he wished to
        know why Kee-o-kuk could not ride as good a horse as any white man?” He
        here received a round of applause, and the interpreter, Mr. Le Clair,
        rose and stated to the audience, that he recognized the horse the
        moment it was shewn, and that it was a faithful portrait of the horse
        that he sold to Kee-o-kuk for 300 dollars, and that it was the finest
        horse on the frontier, belonging either to red or white man.</p>

      <p>In a few minutes afterwards I was exhibiting several of my paintings of
        buffalo-hunts, and describing the modes of slaying them with bows and
        arrows, when I made the assertion which I had often been in the habit
        of making, that there were many instances where the arrow was thrown
        entirely through the buffalo’s body; and that I had several times
        witnessed this astonishing feat. I saw evidently by the motions of my
        audience, that many doubted the correctness of my assertion; and I
        appealed to <em>Kee-o-kuk</em>, who rose up when the thing was explained
        to him, and said, that it had repeatedly happened amongst his tribe;
        and he believed that one of his young men by his side had done it. The
        young man instantly stepped up on the bench, and took a bow from under
        his robe, with which he told the audience he had driven his arrow quite
        through a buffalo’s body. And, there being forty of the Sioux from the
        Upper Missouri also present, the same question was put to them, when
        the chief arose, and addressing himself to the audience, said that it
        was a thing very often done by the hunters in his tribe.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORT MOULTRIE, <i>SOUTH CAROLINA</i>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the date of my last Letter, I have been a wanderer as usual,
    and am now at least 2000 miles from the place where it was dated. At
    this place are held 250 of the Seminolees and Euchees, prisoners of
    war, who are to be kept here awhile longer, and transferred to the
    country assigned them, 700 miles West of the Mississippi, and 1400 from
    this. The famous <em>Os-ce-o-la</em> is amongst the prisoners; and also
    <em>Mick-e-no-pah</em>, the head chief of the tribe, and <em>Cloud</em>,
    <em>King Phillip</em>, and several others of the distinguished men of the
    nation, who have celebrated themselves in the war that is now waging
    with the United States’ Government.</p>

  <p>There is scarcely any need of my undertaking in an epistle of this
    kind, to give a full account of this tribe, of their early history—of
    their former or present location—or of their present condition, and the
    disastrous war they are now waging with the United States’ Government,
    who have held an invading army in their country for four or five years,
    endeavouring to dispossess them and compel them to remove to the West,
    in compliance with Treaty stipulations. These are subjects generally
    understood already (being matters of history), and I leave them to the
    hands of those who will do them more complete justice than I could
    think of doing at this time, with the little space that I could allow
    them; in the confident hope that justice may be meted out to them, at
    least by the historian, if it should not be by their great Guardian,
    who takes it upon herself, as with all the tribes, affectionately to
    <em>call</em> them her “<em>red children</em>.”</p>

  <p>For those who know nothing of the Seminolees, it may be proper for me
    here just to remark, that they are a tribe of three or four thousand;
    occupying the peninsula of Florida—and speaking the language of the
    Creeks, of whom I have heretofore spoken, and who were once a part of
    the same tribe.</p>

  <p>The word Seminolee is a Creek word, signifying runaways; a name which
    was given to a part of the Creek nation, who emigrated in a body to a
    country farther South, where they have lived to the present day; and
    continually extended their dominions by overrunning the once numerous
    tribe that occupied the Southern extremity of the Florida Cape, called
    the Euchees; whom they have at last nearly annihilated, and taken the
    mere <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>remnant of them in, as a part of their tribe. With this tribe
    the Government have been engaged in deadly and disastrous warfare for
    four or five years; endeavouring to remove them from their lands, in
    compliance with a Treaty stipulation, which the Government claims to
    have been justly made, and which the Seminolees aver, was not. Many
    millions of money, and some hundreds of lives of officers and men have
    already been expended in the attempt to dislodge them; and much more
    will doubtless be yet spent before they can be removed from their
    almost impenetrable swamps and hiding-places, to which they can, for
    years to come, retreat; and from which they will be enabled, and no
    doubt disposed, in their exasperated state, to make continual sallies
    upon the unsuspecting and defenceless inhabitants of the country;
    carrying their relentless feelings to be reeked in cruel vengeance on
    the unoffending and innocent.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

  </figure >

  <p>The prisoners who are held here, to the number of 250, men, women
    and children, have been captured during the recent part of this
    warfare, and amongst them the distinguished personages whom I named
    a few moments since; of these, the most conspicuous at this time is
    Os-ce-o-la (<a href="#i_298"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 298</a>), commonly called Powell, as he is
    generally supposed to be a half-breed, the son of a white man (by that
    name), and a Creek woman.</p>

  <p>I have painted him precisely in the costume, in which he stood for his
    picture, even to a string and a trinket. He wore three ostrich feathers
    in his head, and a turban made of a vari-coloured cotton shawl—and his
    dress was chiefly of calicoes, with a handsome bead sash or belt around
    his waist, and his rifle in his hand.</p>

  <p>This young man is, no doubt, an extraordinary character, as he has been
    for some years reputed, and doubtless looked upon by the Seminolees as
    the master spirit and leader of the tribe, although he is not a chief.
    From his boyhood, he had led an energetic and desperate sort of life,
    which had secured for him a conspicuous position in society; and when
    the desperate circumstances of war were agitating his country, he at
    once took a conspicuous and decided part; and in some way whether he
    deserved it or not, acquired an influence and a name that soon sounded
    to the remotest <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>parts of the United States, and amongst the Indian
    tribes, to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>This gallant fellow, who was, undoubtedly, <em>captured</em> a few months
    since, with several of his chiefs and warriors, was at first brought
    in, to Fort Mellon in Florida, and afterwards sent to this place for
    safe-keeping, where he is grieving with a broken spirit, and ready to
    die, cursing white man, no doubt, to the end of his breath.</p>

  <p>The surgeon of the post, Dr. Weedon, who has charge of him, and has
    been with him ever since he was taken prisoner, has told me from day to
    day, that he will not live many weeks; and I have my doubts whether he
    will, from the rapid decline I have observed in his face and his flesh
    since I arrived here.</p>

  <p>During the time that I have been here, I have occupied a large room in
    the officers’ quarters, by the politeness of Captain Morrison, who has
    command of the post, and charge of the prisoners; and on every evening,
    after painting all day at their portraits, I have had Os-ce-o-la,
    Mick-e-no-pa, Cloud, Co-a-had-jo, King Phillip, and others in my room,
    until a late hour at night, where they have taken great pains to give
    me an account of the war, and the mode in which they were captured, of
    which they complain bitterly.</p>

  <p>I am fully convinced from all that I have seen, and learned from the
    lips of Os-ce-o-la, and from the chiefs who are around him, that he is
    a most extraordinary man, and one entitled to a better fate.</p>

  <p>In stature he is about at mediocrity, with an elastic and graceful
    movement; in his face he is good looking, with rather an effeminate
    smile; but of so peculiar a character, that the world may be ransacked
    over without finding another just like it. In his manners, and all his
    movements in company, he is polite and gentlemanly, though all his
    conversation is entirely in his own tongue; and his general appearance
    and actions, those of a full-blooded and wild Indian.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_299"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 299</a>, is a portrait of <em>Ye-how-lo-gee</em> (the
    cloud), generally known by the familiar name of “<em>Cloud</em>.” This is
    one of the chiefs, and a very good-natured, jolly man, growing fat in
    his imprisonment, where he gets enough to eat, and an occasional drink
    of whiskey from the officers, with whom he is a great favourite.</p>

  <p><em>Ee-mat-la</em> (“King Philip,” <a href="#i_299"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 300</a>) is also a very
    aged chief, who has been a man of great notoriety and distinction in
    his time, but has now got too old for further warlike enterprize.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

  <p><em>Co-ee-ha-jo</em> (<a href="#i_301"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 301</a>), is another chief who has been
    a long time distinguished in the tribe, having signalized himself very
    much by his feats in the present war.</p>

  <p><em>La-shee</em> (the licker, <a href="#i_301"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 302</a>), commonly called “Creek
    Billy,” is a distinguished brave of the tribe, and a very handsome
    fellow.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_303"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 303</a>, is the portrait of a Seminolee boy, about nine
    years of age;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and <a href="#i_304"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 304</a>, a Seminolee woman.</p>

  <p><em>Mick-e-no-pah</em> (<a href="#i_305"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 305</a>), is the head chief of the
    tribe, and a very lusty and dignified man. He took great pleasure in
    being present every day in my room, whilst I was painting the others;
    but positively refused to be painted, until he found that a bottle
    of whiskey, and another of wine, which I kept on my mantelpiece, by
    permission of my kind friend Captain Morrison, were only to deal out
    their occasional kindnesses to those who sat for their portraits;
    when he at length agreed to be painted, “if I could make a fair
    likeness of his <em>legs</em>,” which he had very tastefully dressed in
    a handsome pair of red leggings, and upon which I at once began, (as
    he sat cross-legged), by painting <em>them</em> on the lower part of
    the canvass, leaving room for his body and head above; all of which,
    through the irresistible influence of a few kindnesses from my bottle
    of wine, I soon had fastened to the canvass, where they will firmly
    stand I trust, for some hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>Since I finished my portrait of Os-ce-o-la, and since writing the
    first part of this Letter, he has been extremely sick, and lies so
    yet, with an alarming attack of the quinsey or putrid sore throat,
    which will probably end his career in a few days. Two or three times
    the surgeon has sent for the officers of the Garrison and myself, to
    come and see him “<em>dying</em>”—we were with him the night before last
    till the middle of the night, every moment expecting his death; but
    he has improved during the last twenty-four hours, and there is some
    slight prospect of his recovery.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The steamer starts <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>to-morrow
    morning for New York, and I must use the opportunity; so I shall from
    necessity, leave the subject of Os-ce-o-la and the Seminolees for
    future consideration. Adieu.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> The above Letter was written in the winter of 1838,
      and by the Secretary at War’s Report, a year and a half ago, it is
      seen that 36,000,000 of dollars had been already expended in the
      Seminolee war, as well as the lives of 12 or 1400 officers and men,
      and defenceless inhabitants, who have fallen victims to the violence
      of the enraged savages and diseases of the climate. And at the present
      date, August, 1841, I see by the American papers, that the war is
      being prosecuted at this time with its wonted vigour; and that the
      best troops in our country, and the lives of our most valued officers
      are yet jeopardised in the deadly swamps of Florida, with little more
      certainty of a speedy termination of the war, than there appeared five
      years ago.

      <p>The world will pardon me for saying no more of this inglorious war, for
        it will be seen that I am too near the end of my book, to afford it
        the requisite space; and as an American citizen, I would pray, amongst
        thousands of others, that all books yet to be made, might have as good
        an excuse for leaving it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> This veteran old warrior died a few weeks after I painted
      his portrait, whilst on his way, with the rest of the prisoners, to the
      Arkansas.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> This remarkably fine boy, by the name of <em>Os-ce-o-la
        Nick-a-no-chee</em>, has recently been brought from America to London,
        by Dr. Welch, an Englishman, who has been for several years residing in
        Florida. The boy it seems, was captured by the United States troops,
        at the age of six years: but how my friend the Doctor got possession
        of him, and leave to bring him away I never have heard. He is acting
        a very praiseworthy part however, by the paternal fondness he evinces
        for the child, and fairly proves, by the very great pains he is taking
        with his education. The doctor has published recently, a very neat
        volume, containing the boy’s history; and also a much fuller account of
        Os-ce-o-la, and incidents of the Florida war, to which I would refer
        the reader.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> From accounts which left Fort Moultrie a few days
      after I returned home, it seems, that this ill-fated warrior died, a
      prisoner, the next morning after I left him. And the following very
      interesting account of his last moments, was furnished me by Dr.
      Weedon, the surgeon who was by him, with the officers of the garrison,
      at Os-ce-o-la’s request.

      <p>“About half an hour before he died, he seemed to be sensible that he
        was dying; and although he could not speak, he signified by signs that
        he wished me to send for the chiefs and for the officers of the post,
        whom I called in. He made signs to his wives (of whom he had two, and
        also two fine little children by his side,) to go and bring his full
        dress, which he wore in time of war; which having been brought in, he
        rose up in his bed, which was on the floor, and put on his shirt, his
        leggings and moccasins—girded on his war-belt—his bullet-pouch and
        powder-horn, and laid his knife by the side of him on the floor. He
        then called for his red paint, and his looking-glass, which was held
        before him, when he deliberately painted one half of his face, his neck
        and his throat—his wrists—the backs of his hands, and the handle of
        his knife, red with vermilion; a custom practiced when the irrevocable
        oath of war and destruction is taken. His knife he then placed in its
        sheath, under his belt; and he carefully arranged his turban on his
        head, and his three ostrich plumes that he was in the habit of wearing
        in it. Being thus prepared in full dress, he laid down a few minutes to
        recover strength sufficient, when he rose up as before, and with most
        benignant and pleasing smiles, extended his hand to me and to all of
        the officers and chiefs that were around him; and shook hands with us
        all in dead silence; and also with his wives and his little children;
        he made a signal for them to lower him down upon his bed, which was
        done, and he then slowly drew from his war-belt, his scalping-knife,
        which he firmly grasped in his right hand, laying it across the other,
        on his breast, and in a moment smiled away his last breath, without a
        struggle or a groan.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">NORTH WESTERN FRONTIER.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Having</span> finished my travels in the “Far West” for awhile, and being
    detained a little time, sans occupation, in my nineteenth or twentieth
    transit of what, in common parlance is denominated the Frontier; I
    have seated myself down to give some further account of it, and of the
    doings and habits of people, both red and white, who live upon it.</p>

  <p>The Frontier may properly be denominated the fleeting and unsettled
    line extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Lake of the Woods,
    a distance of three thousand miles; which indefinitely separates
    civilized from Indian population—a moving barrier, where the
    unrestrained and natural propensities of two people are concentrated,
    in an atmosphere of lawless iniquity, that offends Heaven, and holds in
    mutual ignorance of each other, the honourable and virtuous portions of
    two people, which seem destined never to meet.</p>

  <p>From what has been said in the foregoing epistles, the reader will
    agree that I have pretty closely adhered to my promise made in the
    commencement of them; that I should confine my remarks chiefly to
    people I have visited, and customs that I have <em>seen</em>, rather
    than by taking up his time with matter that might be gleaned from
    books. He will also agree, that I have principally devoted my pages,
    as I promised, to an account of the condition and customs of those
    Indians whom I have found entirely beyond the Frontier, acting and
    living as Nature taught them to live and act, without the examples, and
    consequently without the taints of civilized encroachments.</p>

  <p>He will, I flatter myself, also yield me some credit for devoting
    the time and space I have occupied in my first appeal to the world,
    entirely to the condition and actions of the <em>living</em>, rather than
    fatiguing him with <em>theories</em> of the living or the dead. I have
    theories enough of my own, and have as closely examined the condition
    and customs of these people on the Frontier, as of those living beyond
    it—and also their past and present, and prospective history; but the
    reader will have learned, that my chief object in these Letters, has
    been not only to describe what I have <em>seen</em>, but of <em>those</em>
    things, such as I deemed the most novel and least understood; which has
    of course confined my remarks heretofore, mostly to the character and
    condition of those tribes living entirely in a state of nature.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

  <p>And as I have now a little leisure, and no particular tribes before me
    to speak of, the reader will allow me to glance my eye over the whole
    Indian country for awhile, both along the Frontier and beyond it;
    taking a hasty and brief survey of them, and their prospects in the
    aggregate; and by not <em>seeing</em> quite as distinctly as I have been
    in the habit of doing heretofore, taking pains to tell a little more
    emphatically what I <em>think</em>, and what I have <em>thought</em> of
    those things that I have seen, and yet have told but in part.</p>

  <p>I have seen a vast many of these wild people in my travels, it will be
    admitted by all. And I have had toils and difficulties, and dangers
    to encounter in paying them my visits; yet I have had my pleasures as
    I went along, in shaking their friendly hands, that never had felt
    the contaminating touch of <em>money</em>, or the withering embrace of
    pockets; I have shared the comforts of their hospitable wigwams, and
    always have been preserved unharmed in their country. And if I have
    spoken, or am to speak of them, with a seeming bias, the reader will
    know what allowance to make for me, who am standing as the champion of
    a people, who have treated me kindly, of whom I feel bound to speak
    well; and who have no means of speaking for themselves.</p>

  <p>Of the dead, to speak kindly, and to their character to render justice,
    is always a praiseworthy act; but it is yet far more charitable to
    extend the hand of liberality, or to hold the scale of justice, to the
    <em>living</em> who are able to feel the benefit of it. Justice to the
    dead is generally a charity, inasmuch as it is a kindness to living
    friends; but to the poor Indian dead, if it is meted out at all, which
    is seldom the case, it is thrown to the grave with him, where he has
    generally gone without friends left behind him to inherit the little
    fame that is reluctantly allowed him while living, and much less
    likely to be awarded to him when dead. Of the thousands and millions,
    therefore, of these poor fellows who are dead, and whom we have thrown
    into their graves, there is nothing that I could now say, that would
    do them any good, or that would not answer the world as well at a
    future time as at the present; while there is a debt that we are owing
    to those of them who are yet living, which I think justly demands our
    attention, and all our sympathies at this moment.</p>

  <p>The peculiar condition in which we are obliged to contemplate these
    most unfortunate people at this time—hastening to destruction and
    extinction, as they evidently are, lays an uncompromising claim upon
    the sympathies of the civilized world, and gives a deep interest and
    value to such records as are truly made—setting up, and perpetuating
    from the life, their true native character and customs.</p>

  <p>If the great family of North American Indians were all dying by a
    scourge or epidemic of the country, it would be natural, and a virtue,
    to weep for them; but merely to sympathize with them (and but partially
    to do that) when they are dying at our hands, and rendering their glebe
    to our possession, would be to subvert the simplest law of Nature, and
    turn civilized man, with all his boasted virtues, back to worse than
    savage barbarism.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

  <p>Justice to a nation who are dying, need never be expected from
    the hands of their destroyers; and where injustice and injury are
    visited upon the weak and defenceless, from ten thousand hands—from
    Governments—monopolies and individuals—the offence is lost in the
    inseverable iniquity in which all join, and for which nobody is
    answerable, unless it be for their respective amounts, at a final day
    of retribution.</p>

  <p>Long and cruel experience has well proved that it is impossible for
    enlightened Governments or money-making individuals to deal with these
    credulous and unsophisticated people, without the sin of injustice;
    but the humble biographer or historian, who goes amongst them from a
    different motive, <em>may</em> come out of their country with his hands
    and his conscience clean, and himself an anomaly, a white man dealing
    with Indians, and meting out justice to them; which I hope it may be my
    good province to do with my pen and my brush, with which, at least, I
    will have the singular and valuable satisfaction of having done them no
    harm.</p>

  <p>With this view, and a desire to render justice to my readers also, I
    have much yet to say of the general appearance and character of the
    Indians—of their condition and treatment; and far more, I fear, than
    I can allot to the little space I have designed for the completion of
    these epistles.</p>

  <p>Of the <em>general appearance</em> of the North American Indians,
    much might be yet said, that would be new and instructive. In
    <em>stature</em>, as I have already said, there are some of the tribes
    that are considerably above the ordinary height of man, and others
    that are evidently below it; allowing their average to be about equal
    to that of their fellow-men in the civilized world. In girth they
    are less, and lighter in their limbs, and almost entirely free from
    corpulency or useless flesh. Their bones are lighter, their skulls are
    thinner, and their muscles less hard than those of their civilized
    neighbours, excepting in the legs and feet, where they are brought
    into more continual action by their violent exercise on foot and on
    horseback, which swells the muscles and gives them great strength in
    those limbs, which is often quite as conspicuous as the extraordinary
    development of muscles in the shoulders and arms of our labouring men.</p>

  <p>Although the Indians are generally narrow in the shoulders, and less
    powerful with the arms, yet it does not always happen by any means,
    that they are so effeminate as they look, and so widely inferior in
    brachial strength, as the spectator is apt to believe, from the smooth
    and rounded appearance of their limbs. The contrast between one of our
    labouring men when he denudes his limbs, and the figure of a naked
    Indian is to be sure very striking, and entirely too much so, for the
    actual difference in the power of the two persons. There are several
    reasons for this which account for so disproportionate a contrast, and
    should be named.</p>

  <p>The labouring man, who is using his limbs the greater part of his life
    in lifting heavy weights, &amp;c. sweats them with the weight of clothes
    which he has on him, which softens the integuments and the flesh,
    leaving the muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> to stand out in more conspicuous relief when they
    are exposed; whilst the Indian, who exercises his limbs for the most
    of his life, denuded and exposed to the air, gets over his muscles a
    thicker and more compact layer of integuments which hide them from the
    view, leaving the casual spectator, who sees them only at rest, to
    suppose them too decidedly inferior to those which are found amongst
    people of his own colour. Of muscular strength in the legs, I have met
    many of the most extraordinary instances in the Indian country, that
    ever I have seen in my life; and I have watched and studied such for
    hours together, with utter surprise and admiration, in the violent
    exertions of their dances, where they leap and jump with every nerve
    strung, and every muscle swelled, till their legs will often look like
    a bundle of ropes, rather than a mass of human flesh. And from all that
    I have seen, I am inclined to say, that whatever differences there may
    be between the North American Indians and their civilized neighbours
    in the above respects, they are decidedly the results of different
    habits of life and modes of education rather than of any difference in
    constitution. And I would also venture the assertion, that he who would
    see the Indian in a condition to judge of his muscles, must see him
    in motion; and he who would get a perfect study for an Hercules or an
    Atlas, should take a stone-mason for the upper part of his figure, and
    a Camanchee or a Blackfoot Indian from the waist downwards to the feet.</p>

  <p>There is a general and striking character in the facial outline of the
    North American Indians, which is bold and free, and would seem at once
    to stamp them as distinct from natives of other parts of the world.
    Their noses are generally prominent and aquiline—and the whole face, if
    divested of paint and of copper-colour, would seem to approach to the
    bold and European character. Many travellers have thought that their
    eyes were smaller than those of Europeans; and there is good cause for
    one to believe so, if he judges from first impressions, without taking
    pains to inquire into the truth and causes of things. I have been
    struck, as most travellers, no doubt have, with the want of expansion
    and apparent smallness of the Indians’ eyes, which I have found upon
    examination, to be principally the effect of continual exposure to the
    rays of the sun and the wind, without the shields that are used by the
    civilized world; and also when in-doors, and free from those causes,
    subjected generally to one more distressing, and calculated to produce
    similar results, the smoke that almost continually hangs about their
    wigwams, which necessarily contracts the lids of the eyes, forbidding
    that full flame and expansion of the eye, that the cool and clear
    shades of our civilized domicils are calculated to promote.</p>

  <p>The teeth of the Indians are generally regular and sound, and
    wonderfully preserved to old age, owing, no doubt, to the fact that
    they live without the spices of life—without saccharine and without
    salt, which are equally destructive to teeth, in civilized communities.
    Their teeth, though sound, are not white, having a yellowish cast; but
    for the same reason that a negro’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> teeth are “like ivory,” they look
    white—set as they are in bronze, as any one with a <em>tolerable</em> set
    of teeth can easily test, by painting his face the colour of an Indian,
    and grinning for a moment in his looking-glass.</p>

  <p><em>Beards</em> they generally have not—esteeming them great vulgarities,
    and using every possible means to eradicate them whenever they are so
    unfortunate as to be annoyed with them. Different writers have been
    very much at variance on this subject ever since the first accounts
    given of these people; and there seems still an unsatisfied curiosity
    on the subject, which I would be glad to say that I could put entirely
    at rest.</p>

  <p>From the best information that I could obtain amongst forty-eight
    tribes that I have visited, I feel authorized to say, that, amongst
    the wild tribes, where they have made no efforts to imitate white men,
    at least, the proportion of eighteen out of twenty, by nature are
    entirely without the appearance of a beard; and of the very few who
    have them by nature, nineteen out of twenty eradicate it by plucking it
    out several times in succession, precisely at the age of puberty, when
    its growth is successfully arrested; and occasionally one may be seen,
    who has omitted to destroy it at that time, and subjects his chin to
    the repeated pains of its extractions, which he is performing with a
    pair of clamshells or other tweezers, nearly every day of his life—and
    occasionally again, but still more rarely, one is found, who from
    carelessness or inclination has omitted both of these, and is allowing
    it to grow to the length of an inch or two on his chin, in which case
    it is generally very soft, and exceedingly sparse. Wherever there is a
    cross of the blood with the European or African, which is frequently
    the case along the Frontier, a proportionate beard is the result; and
    it is allowed to grow, or is plucked out with much toil, and with great
    pain.</p>

  <p>There has been much speculation, and great variety of opinions, as
    to the results of the intercourse between the European and African
    population with the Indians on the borders; and I would not undertake
    to decide so difficult a question, though I cannot help but express
    my opinion, which is made up from the vast many instances that I have
    seen, that generally speaking, these half-breed specimens are in both
    instances a decided deterioration from the two stocks, from which they
    have sprung; which I grant may be the consequence that generally flows
    from illicit intercourse, and from the inferior rank in which they are
    held by both, (which is mostly confined to the lowest and most degraded
    portions of society), rather than from any constitutional objection,
    necessarily growing out of the amalgamation.</p>

  <p>The finest built and most powerful men that I have ever yet seen, have
    been some of the last-mentioned, the negro and the North American
    Indian mixed, of equal blood. These instances are rare to be sure, yet
    are occasionally to be found amongst the Seminolees and Cherokees,
    and also amongst the Camanchees, even, and the Caddoes; and I account
    for it in this way: From the slave-holding States to the heart of the
    country of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> wild tribe of Indians, through almost boundless and
    impassable wilds and swamps, for hundreds of miles, it requires a
    negro of extraordinary leg and courage and perseverance, to travel;
    absconding from his master’s fields, to throw himself into a tribe
    of wild and hostile Indians, for the enjoyment of his liberty; of
    which there are occasional instances, and when they succeed, they are
    admired by the savage; and as they come with a good share of the tricks
    and arts of civilization, they are at once looked upon by the tribe,
    as extraordinary and important personages; and generally marry the
    daughters of chiefs, thus uniting theirs with the best blood in the
    nation, which produce these remarkably fine and powerful men that I
    have spoken of above.</p>

  <p>Although the Indians of North America, where dissipation and disease
    have not got amongst them, undoubtedly are a longer lived and healthier
    race, and capable of enduring far more bodily privation and pain,
    than civilized people can; yet I do not believe that the differences
    are constitutional, or anything more than the results of different
    circumstances, and a different education. As an evidence in support
    of this assertion, I will allude to the hundreds of men whom I have
    seen, and travelled with, who have been for several years together in
    the Rocky Mountains, in the employment of the Fur Companies; where
    they have lived exactly upon the Indian system, continually exposed
    to the open air, and the weather, and, to all the disappointments and
    privations peculiar to that mode of life; and I am bound to say, that I
    never saw a more hardy and healthy race of men in my life, whilst they
    remain in the country; nor any who fall to pieces quicker when they get
    back to confined and dissipated life, which they easily fall into, when
    they return to their own country.</p>

  <p>The Indian women who are obliged to lead lives of severe toil and
    drudgery, become exceedingly healthy and robust, giving easy birth
    and strong constitutions to their children; which, in a measure, may
    account for the simplicity and fewness of their diseases, which in
    infancy and childhood are very seldom known to destroy life.</p>

  <p>If there were anything like an equal proportion of deaths amongst the
    Indian children, that is found in the civilized portions of the world,
    the Indian country would long since have been depopulated, on account
    of the decided disproportion of children they produce. It is a very
    rare occurrence for an Indian woman to be “<em>blessed</em>” with more
    than four or five children during her life; and generally speaking,
    they seem contented with two or three; when in civilized communities
    it is no uncommon thing for a woman to be the mother of ten or twelve,
    and sometimes to bear two or even three at a time; of which I never
    recollect to have met an instance during all my extensive travels in
    the Indian country, though it is possible that I might occasionally
    have passed them.</p>

  <p>For so striking a dissimilarity as there evidently is between these
    people, and those living according to the more artificial modes of
    life, in a subject, seemingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> alike natural to both, the reader will
    perhaps expect me to furnish some rational and decisive causes. Several
    very plausible reasons have been advanced for such a deficiency on the
    part of the Indians, by authors who have written on the subject, but
    whose opinions I should be very slow to adopt; inasmuch as they have
    been based upon the Indian’s inferiority, (as the same authors have
    taken great pains to prove in most other respects,) to their pale-faced
    neighbours.</p>

  <p>I know of but one decided cause for this difference, which I would
    venture to advance, and which I confidently believe to be the principal
    obstacle to a more rapid increase of their families; which is the very
    great length of time that the women submit to lactation, generally
    carrying their children at the breast to the age of two, and sometimes
    three, and even four years!</p>

  <p>The astonishing ease and success with which the Indian women pass
    through the most painful and most trying of all human difficulties,
    which fall exclusively to the lot of the gentler sex; is quite equal,
    I have found from continued enquiry, to the representations that
    have often been made to the world by other travellers, who have gone
    before me. Many people have thought this a wise provision of Nature,
    in framing the constitutions of these people, to suit the exigencies
    of their exposed lives, where they are beyond the pale of skilful
    surgeons, and the nice little comforts that visit the sick beds in the
    enlightened world; but I never have been willing to give to Nature
    quite so much credit, for stepping aside of her own rule, which I
    believe to be about half way between—from which I am inclined to think
    that the refinements of art, and its spices, have led the civilized
    world into the pains and perils of one unnatural extreme; whilst the
    extraordinary fatigue and exposure, and habits of Indian life, have
    greatly released them from natural pains, on the other. With this
    view of the case, I fully believe that Nature has dealt everywhere
    impartially; and that, if from their childhood, our mothers had, like
    the Indian women, carried loads like beasts of burthen—and those over
    the longest journeys, and highest mountains—had swam the broadest
    rivers—and galloped about for months and even years of their lives,
    <em>astride</em> of their horse’s backs; we should have taxed them as
    lightly in stepping into the world, as an Indian pappoose does its
    mother, who ties her horse under the shade of a tree for half an hour,
    and before night, overtakes her travelling companions with her infant
    in her arms, which has often been the case.</p>

  <p>As to the probable origin of the North American Indians, which is one
    of the first questions that suggests itself to the enquiring mind,
    and will be perhaps, the last to be settled; I shall have little to
    say in this place, for the reason that so abstruse a subject, and
    one so barren of positive proof, would require in its discussion too
    much circumstantial evidence for my allowed limits; which I am sure
    the world will agree will be filled up much more consistently with
    the avowed spirit of this work, by treating of that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> admits
    of an abundance of proof—their actual existence, their customs—and
    misfortunes; and the suggestions of modes for the amelioration of their
    condition.</p>

  <p>For a professed philanthropist, I should deem it cruel and hypocritical
    to waste time and space in the discussion of a subject, ever so
    interesting, (though unimportant), when the present condition and
    prospects of these people are calling so loudly upon the world for
    justice, and for mercy; and when their evanescent existence and customs
    are turning, as it were, on a wheel before us, but soon to be lost;
    whilst the mystery of their origin can as well be fathomed at a future
    day as now, and recorded with their exit.</p>

  <p>Very many people look upon the savages of this vast country, as an
    “<em>Anomaly in Nature</em>;” and their existence and origin, and
    locality, things that needs must be at once accounted for.</p>

  <p>Now, if the world will allow me, (and perhaps they may think me
    singular for saying it), I would say, that these things are, in my
    opinion, natural and simple; and, like all other works of Nature,
    destined to remain a mystery to mortal man; and if man be anywhere
    entitled to the name of an anomaly, it is he who has departed the
    farthest from the simple walks and actions of his nature.</p>

  <p>It seems natural to enquire at once who these people are, and from
    whence they came; but this question is natural, only because we are
    out of nature. To an Indian, such a question would seem absurd—he
    would stand aghast and astounded at the <em>anomaly</em> before
    <em>him</em>—himself upon his own ground, “where the Great Spirit made
    him”—hunting in his own forests; if an exotic, with a “pale face,” and
    from across the ocean, should stand before him, to ask him where he
    came from, and how he got there!</p>

  <p>I would invite this querist, this votary of science, to sit upon a log
    with his red acquaintance, and answer the following questions:—</p>

  <p>“You white man, where you come from?”</p>

  <p>“From England, across the water.”</p>

  <p>“How white man come to see England? how you face come to get white, ha?”</p>

  <p>I never yet have been made to see the <em>necessity</em> of showing how
    these people <em>came here</em>, or that they <em>came here</em> at all;
    which might easily have been done, by the way of Behring’s Straits
    from the North of Asia. I should much rather dispense with such a
    <em>necessity</em>, than undertake the other necessities that must follow
    the establishment of this; those of showing how the savages paddled or
    drifted in their canoes from this Continent, after they had got here,
    or from the Asiatic Coast, and landed on all the South Sea Islands,
    which we find to be inhabited nearly to the South Pole. For myself I
    am quite satisfied with the fact, which is a thing certain, and to be
    relied on, that this Continent was found peopled in every part, by
    savages; and so, nearly every Island in the South Seas, at the distance
    of several thousand miles from either Continent; and I am quite willing
    to surrender the mystery to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> abler pens than my own—to theorists who
    may have the time, and the means to prove to the world, how those rude
    people wandered there in their bark canoes, without water for their
    subsistence, or compasses to guide them on their way.</p>

  <p>The North American Indians, and all the inhabitants of the South Sea
    Islands, speaking some two or three hundred different languages,
    entirely dissimilar, may have all sprung from one stock; and the
    Almighty, after creating man. for some reason that is unfathomable
    to human wisdom, might have left the whole vast universe, with its
    severed continents, and its thousand distant isles everywhere teeming
    with necessaries and luxuries, spread out for man’s use; and there to
    vegetate and rot, for hundreds and even thousands of centuries, until
    ultimate, <em>abstract</em> accident should throw him amongst these
    infinite mysteries of creation; the least and most insignificant of
    which have been created and placed by design. Human reason is weak,
    and human ignorance is palpable, when man attempts to approach these
    unsearchable mysteries; and I consider human discretion well applied,
    when it beckons him back to things that he can comprehend; where his
    reason, and all his mental energies can be employed for the advancement
    and benefit of his species. With this conviction, I feel disposed to
    retreat to the ground that I have before occupied—to the Indians, as
    they are, and <em>where</em> they are; recording amongst them living
    evidences whilst they live, for the use of abler theorists than
    myself—who may labour to establish their origin, which may be as well
    (and perhaps better) done, a century hence, than at the present day.</p>

  <p>The reader is apprised, that I have nearly filled the limits allotted
    to these epistles; and I assure him that a vast deal which I have seen
    must remain untold—whilst from the same necessity, I must tell him much
    less than I think, and beg to be pardoned if I withhold, till some
    future occasion, many of my reasons for, <em>thinking</em>.</p>

  <p>I believe, with many others, that the North American Indians are a
    mixed people—that they have Jewish blood in their veins, though I
    would not assert, as some have undertaken to prove, “<em>that they are
    Jews</em>,” or that they are “<em>the ten lost tribes of Israel</em>.”
    From the character and conformation of their heads, I am compelled
    to look upon them as an amalgam race, but still savages; and from
    many of their customs, which seem to me, to be peculiarly Jewish, as
    well as from the character of their heads, I am forced to believe
    that some part of those ancient tribes, who have been dispersed by
    Christians in so many ways, and in so many different eras, have found
    their way To this country, where they have entered amongst the native
    stock, and have lived and intermarried with the Indians, until their
    identity has been swallowed up and lost in the greater numbers of
    their new acquaintance, save the bold and decided character which they
    have bequeathed to the Indian races; and such of their customs as the
    Indians were pleased to adopt, and which they have preserved to the
    present day.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

  <p>I am induced to believe thus from the very many customs which I have
    witnessed amongst them, that appear to be decidedly Jewish; and many of
    them so peculiarly so, that it would seem almost impossible, or at all
    events, exceedingly improbable, that two people in a state of nature
    should have hit upon them, and practiced them exactly alike.</p>

  <p>The world need not expect me to <em>decide</em> so interesting and
    difficult a question; but I am sure they will be disposed to hear
    simply my opinion, which I give in this place, quite briefly, and with
    the utmost respectful deference to those who think differently. I claim
    no merit whatever, for advancing such an opinion, which is not new,
    having been in several works advanced to the world by far abler pens
    than my own, with volumes of evidence, to the catalogue of which, I
    feel quite sure I shall be able to add some new proofs in the proper
    place. If I could establish the fact by positive proof, I should claim
    a great deal of applause from the world, and should, no doubt, obtain
    it; but, like everything relating to the origin and early history of
    these unchronicled people, I believe this question is one that will
    never be settled, but will remain open for the opinions of the world,
    which will be variously given, and that upon circumstantial evidence
    alone.</p>

  <p>I am compelled to believe that the Continent of America, and each
    of the other Continents, have had their aboriginal stocks, peculiar
    in colour and in character—and that each of these native stocks has
    undergone repeated mutations (at periods, of which history has kept no
    records), by erratic colonies from abroad, that have been engrafted
    upon them—mingling with them, and materially affecting their original
    character. By this process, I believe that the North American Indians,
    even where we find them in their wildest condition, are several
    degrees removed from their original character; and that one of their
    principal alloys has been a part of those dispersed people, who have
    mingled their blood and their customs with them, and even in their new
    disguise, seem destined to be followed up with oppression and endless
    persecution.</p>

  <p>The first and most striking fact amongst the North American Indians
    that refers us to the Jews, is that of their worshipping in all parts,
    the Great Spirit, or Jehovah, as the Hebrews were ordered to do by
    Divine precept, instead of a plurality of gods, as ancient pagans and
    heathens did—and their idols of their own formation. The North American
    Indians, are nowhere <em>idolaters</em>—they appeal at once to the Great
    Spirit, and know of no mediator, either personal or symbolical.</p>

  <p>The Indian tribes are everywhere divided into bands, with chiefs,
    symbols, badges, &amp;c., and many of their modes of worship I have found
    exceedingly like those of the Mosaic institution. The Jews had their
    <em>sanctum sanctorums</em>, and so may it be said the Indians have,
    in their council or medicine-houses, which are always held as sacred
    places. As the Jews had, they have their high-priests and their
    prophets. Amongst the Indians as amongst the ancient Hebrews, the
    women are not allowed to worship with the men—and in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> cases also,
    they eat separately. The Indians everywhere, like the Jews, believe
    that they are the favourite people of the Great Spirit, and they are
    certainly, like those ancient people, <em>persecuted</em>, as every man’s
    hand seems raised against them—and they, like the Jews, destined to be
    dispersed over the world, and seemingly scourged by the Almighty, and
    despised of man.</p>

  <p>In their marriages, the Indians, as did the ancient Jews, uniformly
    buy their wives by giving presents—and in many tribes, very closely
    resemble them in other forms and ceremonies of their marriages.</p>

  <p>In their preparations for war, and in peace-making, they are strikingly
    similar. In their treatment of the sick, burial of the dead and
    mourning, they are also similar.</p>

  <p>In their bathing and ablutions, at all seasons of the year, as a
    part of their religious observances—having separate places for men
    and women to perform these immersions—they resemble again. And the
    custom amongst the women, of absenting themselves during the lunar
    influences, is exactly consonant to the Mosaic law. This custom of
    <em>separation</em> is an uniform one amongst the different tribes, as
    far as I have seen them in their primitive state, and be it Jewish,
    natural or conventional, it is an indispensable form with these wild
    people, who are setting to the civilized world, this and many other
    examples of decency and propriety, only to be laughed at by their wiser
    neighbours, who, rather than award to the red man any merit for them,
    have taken exceeding pains to call them but the results of ignorance
    and superstition.</p>

  <p>So, in nearly every family of a tribe, will be found a small lodge,
    large enough to contain one person, which is erected at a little
    distance from the family lodge, and occupied by the wife or the
    daughter, to whose possession circumstances allot it; where she dwells
    alone until she is prepared to move back, and in the meantime the
    touch of her hand or her finger to the chief’s lodge, or his gun, or
    other article of his household, consigns it to destruction at once;
    and in case of non-conformity to this indispensable form, a woman’s
    life may, in some tribes, be answerable for misfortunes that happen to
    individuals or the tribe, in the interim.</p>

  <p>After this season of separation, <em>purification</em> in running water,
    and <em>annointing</em>, precisely in accordance with the Jewish command,
    is requisite before she can enter the family lodge. Such is one of the
    extraordinary observances amongst these people in their wild state; but
    along the Frontier, where white people have laughed at them for their
    forms, they have departed from this, as from nearly everything else
    that is native and original about them.</p>

  <p>In their <em>feasts</em>, <em>fastings</em> and <em>sacrificing</em>, they
    are exceedingly like those ancient people. Many of them have a feast
    closely resembling the annual feast of the Jewish passover; and amongst
    others, an occasion much like the Israelitish feast of the tabernacles,
    which lasted eight days, (when history tells us they carried bundles
    of <em>willow boughs</em>, and fasted several days and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> nights) making
    sacrifices of the first fruits and best of everything, closely
    resembling the sin-offering and peace-offering of the Hebrews.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

  <p>These, and many others of their customs would seem to be decidedly
    Jewish; yet it is for the world to decide how many of them, or whether
    all of them, might be natural to all people, and, therefore, as well
    practiced by these people in a state of nature, as to have been
    borrowed from a foreign nation.</p>

  <p>Amongst the list of their customs however, we meet a number which had
    their origin it would seem, in the Jewish Ceremonial code, and which
    are so very <em>peculiar</em> in their forms, that it would seem quite
    improbable, and almost impossible, that two different people should
    ever have hit upon them alike, without some knowledge of each other.
    These I consider, go farther than anything else as evidence, and
    carry, in my mind, conclusive proof that these people are tinctured
    with Jewish blood; even though the Jewish sabbath has been lost,
    and circumcision probably rejected; and dog’s flesh, which was an
    abomination to the Jews, continued to be eaten at their feasts by all
    the tribes of Indians; not because the Jews have been prevailed upon to
    use it, but, because they have survived only, as their blood was mixed
    with that of the Indians, and the Indians have imposed on that mixed
    blood the same rules and regulations that governed the members of the
    tribes in general.</p>

  <p>Many writers are of opinion, that the natives of America are all
    from one stock, and their languages from one root—that that stock is
    exotic, and that that language was introduced with it. And the reason
    assigned for this theory is, that amongst the various tribes, there
    is a reigning similarity in looks—and in their languages a striking
    resemblance to each other.</p>

  <p>Now, if all the world were to argue in this way, I should reason just
    in the other; and pronounce this, though evidence to a certain degree,
    to be very far from conclusive, inasmuch as it is far easier and more
    natural for distinct tribes, or languages, grouped and used together,
    to <em>assimilate</em> than to <em>dissimilate</em>; as the pebbles on
    a sea-shore, that are washed about and jostled together, lose their
    angles, and incline at last to one rounded and uniform shape. So that
    if there had been, <em>ab origine</em>, a variety of different stocks
    in America, with different complexions, with different characters and
    customs, and of different statures, and speaking entirely different
    tongues; where they have been for a series of centuries living
    neighbours to each other, moving about and intermarrying; I think we
    might reasonably look for quite as great a similarity in their personal
    appearance and languages, as we now find; when, on the other hand, if
    we are to suppose that they were all from one foreign stock, with but
    one language, it is a difficult thing to conceive how <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>or in what space
    of time, or for what purpose, they could have formed so many tongues,
    and so widely different, as those that are now spoken on the Continent.</p>

  <p>It is evident I think, that if an island or continent had been peopled
    with black, white and red; a succession of revolving centuries of
    intercourse amongst these different colours would have had a tendency
    to bring them to one standard complexion, when no computable space
    of time, nor any conceivable circumstances could restore them again;
    reproducing all, or either of the distinct colours, from the compound.</p>

  <p>That <em>customs</em> should be found similar, or many of them exactly
    the same, on the most opposite parts of the Continent, is still less
    surprising; for these will travel more rapidly, being more easily
    taught at Treaties and festivals between hostile bands, or disseminated
    by individuals travelling through neighbouring tribes, whilst languages
    and blood require more time for their admixture.</p>

  <p>That the languages of the North American Indians, should be found to be
    so numerous at this day, and so very many of them radically different,
    is a subject of great surprise, and unaccountable, whether these people
    are derived from one individual stock, or from one hundred, or one
    thousand.</p>

  <p>Though languages like colour and like customs, are calculated to
    assimilate, under the circumstances above named; yet it is evident
    that, (if derived from a variety of sources), they have been
    unaccountably kept more distinct than the others; and if from one
    root, have still more unaccountably dissimulated and divided into at
    least one hundred and fifty, two-thirds of which, I venture to say,
    are entirely and radically distinct; whilst amongst the people who
    speak them, there is a reigning similarity in looks, in features and
    in customs, which would go very far to pronounce them one family, by
    nature or by convention.</p>

  <p>I do not believe, with some very learned and distinguished writers,
    that the languages of the North American Indians can be traced to one
    root or to three or four, or any number of distinct idioms; nor do
    I believe all, or any one of them, will ever be fairly traced to a
    foreign origin.</p>

  <p>If the looks and customs of the Jews, are decidedly found and
    identified with these people—and also those of the Japanese, and Calmuc
    Tartars, I think we have but little, if any need of looking for the
    Hebrew language, or either of the others, for the reasons that I have
    already given; for the feeble colonies of these, or any other foreign
    people that might have fallen by accident upon the shores of this great
    Continent, or who might have approached it by Behring’s Straits, have
    been too feeble to give a language to fifteen or twenty millions of
    people, or in fact to any portion of them; being in all probability,
    in great part cut to pieces and destroyed by a natural foe; leaving
    enough perhaps, who had intermarried, to innoculate their blood and
    their customs; which have run, like a drop in a bucket, and slightly
    tinctured the character of tribes who have sternly resisted their
    languages, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> would naturally, under such circumstances, have made
    but very little impression.</p>

  <p>Such I consider the condition of the Jews in North America; and perhaps
    the Scandanavians, and the followers of Madoc, who by some means, and
    some period that I cannot name, have thrown themselves upon the shores
    of this country, and amongst the ranks of the savages; where, from
    destructive wars with their new neighbours, they have been overpowered,
    and perhaps, with the exception of those who had intermarried, they
    have been destroyed, yet leaving amongst the savages decided marks of
    their character; and many of their peculiar customs, which had pleased,
    and been adopted by the savages, while they had sternly resisted
    others: and decidedly shut out and discarded their language, and of
    course obliterated everything of their history.</p>

  <p>That there should often be found contiguous to each other, several
    tribes speaking dialects of the same language, is a matter of no
    surprise at all; and wherever such is the case, there is resemblance
    enough also, in looks and customs, to show that they are parts of the
    same tribes, which have comparatively recently severed and wandered
    apart, as their traditions will generally show; and such resemblances
    are often found and traced, nearly across the Continent, and have
    been accounted for in some of my former Letters. Several very learned
    gentlemen, whose opinions I would treat with the greatest respect,
    have supposed that all the native languages of America were traceable
    to three or four roots; a position which I will venture to say will be
    an exceedingly difficult one for them to maintain, whilst remaining
    at home and consulting books, in the way that too many theories are
    supported; and one infinitely more difficult to prove if they travel
    amongst the different tribes, and collect their own information as
    they travel.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> I am quite certain that I have found in a number of
    instances, tribes who have long lived neighbours to each other, and
    who, from continued intercourse, had learned mutually, many words of
    each others language, and adopted them for common use or mottoes, as
    often, or oftener than we introduce the French or Latin phrases in our
    conversation; from which the casual visitor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>to one of these tribes,
    might naturally suppose there was a similarity in their languages;
    when a closer examiner would find that the idioms and structure of the
    several languages were entirely distinct.</p>

  <p>I believe that in this way, the world who take but a superficial
    glance at them, are, and will be, led into continual error on this
    interesting subject; one that invites, and well deserves from those
    learned gentlemen, a fair investigation by them, <em>on the spot</em>;
    rather than so limited and feeble an examination as <em>I</em> have been
    able to make of it, or that <em>they, can</em> make, in their parlours,
    at so great a distance from them, and through such channels as they are
    obliged to look to for their information.</p>

  <p>Amongst the tribes that I have visited, I consider that thirty, out
    of the forty-eight, are distinct and radically different in their
    languages, and eighteen are dialects of some three or four. It is a
    very simple thing for the off-hand theorists of the scientific world,
    who do not go near these people, to arrange and classify them; and a
    very clever thing to <em>simplify</em> the subject, and bring it, like
    everything else, under three or four heads, and to solve, and resolve
    it, by as many simple rules.</p>

  <p>I do not pretend to be able to give to this subject, or to that of the
    probable origin of these people, the close investigation that these
    interesting subjects require and deserve; yet I have travelled and
    observed enough amongst them, and collected enough, to enable me to
    form decided opinions of my own; and in my conviction, have acquired
    confidence enough to tell them, and at the same time to recommend to
    the Government or institutions of my own country, to employ men of
    science, such as I have mentioned, and protect them in their <em>visits
    to</em> these tribes, where “the truth, and the whole truth” may be got;
    and the languages of all the tribes that are yet in existence, (many
    of which are just now gasping them out in their last breath,) may be
    snatched and preserved from oblivion; as well as their <em>looks</em> and
    their <em>customs</em>, to the preservation of which <em>my</em> labours
    have been principally devoted.</p>

  <p>I undertake to say to such gentlemen, who are enthusiastic and
    qualified, that here is one of the most interesting subjects that they
    could spend the energies of their valuable lives upon, and one the most
    sure to secure for them that immortality for which it is natural and
    fair for all men to look.</p>

  <p>From what has been said in the foregoing Letters, it will have been
    seen that there are three divisions under which the North American
    Indians may be justly considered; those who are dead—those who are
    dying, and those who are yet living and flourishing in their primitive
    condition. Of the <em>dead</em>, I have little to say at present, and I
    can render them no service—of the <em>living</em>, there is much to be
    said, and I shall regret that the prescribed limits of these epistles,
    will forbid me saying all that I desire to say of them and their
    condition.</p>

  <p>The present condition of these once numerous people, contrasted with
    what, it was, and what it is soon to be, is a subject of curious
    interest, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> as some importance, to the civilized world—a
    subject well entitled to the attention, and very justly commanding
    the sympathies of, enlightened communities. There are abundant proofs
    recorded in the history of this country, and to which I need not at
    this time more particularly refer, to shew that this very numerous and
    respectable part of the human family, which occupied the different
    parts of North America, at the time of its first settlement by the
    Anglo-Americans, contained more than fourteen millions, who have
    been reduced since that time, and undoubtedly in consequence of that
    settlement, to something less than two millions!</p>

  <p>This is a startling fact, and one which carries with it, if it be the
    truth, other facts and their results, which are equally startling, and
    such as every inquiring mind should look into. The first deduction that
    the mind draws from such premises, is the rapid declension of these
    people, which must at that rate be going on at this day; and sooner or
    later, lead to the most melancholy result of their final extinction.</p>

  <p>Of this sad termination of their existence, there need not be a doubt
    in the minds of any man who will read the history of their former
    destruction; contemplating them swept already from two-thirds of the
    Continent; and who will then travel as I have done, over the vast
    extent of Frontier, and witness the modes by which the poor fellows are
    falling, whilst contending for their rights, with acquisitive white
    men. Such a reader, and such a traveller, I venture to say, if he has
    not the heart of a brute, will shed tears for them; and be ready to
    admit that their character and customs, are at <em>this time</em>, a
    subject of interest and importance, and rendered peculiarly so from
    the facts that they are dying <em>at the hands</em> of their Christian
    neighbours; and, from all past experience, that there will probably be
    no effectual plan instituted, that will save the remainder of them from
    a similar fate. As they stand at this day, there may be four or five
    hundred thousand in their primitive state; and a million and a half,
    that may be said to be semi-civilized, contending with the sophistry
    of white men, amongst whom they are timidly and unsuccessfully
    endeavouring to hold up their heads, and aping their modes; whilst they
    are swallowing their poisons, and yielding their lands and their lives,
    to the superior tact and cunning of their merciless cajolers.</p>

  <p>In such parts of their community, their customs are uninteresting;
    being but poor and ridiculous imitations of those that are <em>bad
    enough</em>, those practiced by their first teachers—but in their
    primitive state, their modes of life and character, before they are
    changed, are subjects of curious interest, and all that I have aimed
    to preserve. Their personal appearance, their dress, and many of their
    modes of life, I have already described.</p>

  <p>For their Government, which is purely such as has been dictated to them
    by Nature and necessity alone, they are indebted to no foreign, native
    or civilized nation. For their religion, which is simply Theism, they
    are indebted to the Great Spirit, and not to the Christian world. For
    their modes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> of war, they owe nothing to enlightened nations—using only
    those weapons and those modes which are prompted by nature, and within
    the means of their rude manufactures.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, we do not find in their systems of polity and
    jurisprudence, the efficacy and justice that are dispensed in
    civilized institutions—if we do not find in their religion the
    light and the grace that flow from Christian faith—if in wars they
    are less honourable, and wage them upon a system of “<em>murderous
    stratagem</em>,” it is the duty of the enlightened world, who administer
    justice in a better way—who worship in a more acceptable form—and who
    war on a more <em>honourable</em> scale, to make great allowance for
    their ignorance, and yield to their credit, the fact, that if their
    systems are less wise, they are often more free from injustice—from
    hypocrisy and from carnage.</p>

  <p>Their Governments, if they have any (for I am almost disposed to
    question the propriety of applying the term), are generally alike; each
    tribe having at its head, a chief (and most generally a war and civil
    chief), whom it would seem, alternately hold the ascendency, as the
    circumstances of peace or war may demand their respective services.
    These chiefs, whose titles are generally hereditary, hold their offices
    only as long as their ages will enable them to perform the duties
    of them by taking the lead in war-parties, &amp;c., after which they
    devolve upon the next incumbent, who is the eldest son of the chief,
    provided he is decided by the other chiefs to be as worthy of it as any
    other young man in the tribe—in default of which, a chief is elected
    from amongst the sub-chiefs; so that the office is <em>hereditary on
    condition</em>, and <em>elective</em> in <em>emergency</em>.</p>

  <p>The chief has no controul over the life or limbs, or liberty of his
    subjects, nor other power whatever, excepting that of <em>influence</em>
    which he gains by his virtues, and his exploits in war, and which
    induces his warriors and braves to follow him, as he leads them to
    battle—or to listen to him when he speaks and advises in council. In
    fact, he is no more than a <em>leader</em>, whom every young warrior may
    follow, or turn about and go back from, as he pleases, if he is willing
    to meet the disgrace that awaits him, who deserts his chief in the hour
    of danger.</p>

  <p>It may be a difficult question to decide, whether their Government
    savours most of a democracy or an aristocracy; it is in some respects
    purely democratic—and in others aristocratic. The influence of names
    and families is strictly kept up, and their qualities and relative
    distinctions preserved in heraldric family Arms; yet entirely severed,
    and free from influences of wealth, which is seldom amassed by any
    persons in Indian communities; and most sure to slip from the hands of
    chiefs, or others high in office, who are looked upon to be liberal
    and charitable; and oftentimes, for the sake of popularity, render
    themselves the poorest, and most meanly dressed and equipped of any in
    the tribe.</p>

  <p>These people have no written laws, nor others, save the penalties
    affixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> to certain crimes, by long-standing custom, or by the
    decisions of the chiefs in council, who form a sort of Court and
    Congress too, for the investigation of crimes, and transaction of the
    public business. For the sessions of these dignitaries, each tribe
    has, in the middle of their village, a Government or council-house,
    where the chiefs often try and convict, for capital offences—leaving
    the punishment to be inflicted by the nearest of kin, to whom all eyes
    of the nation are turned, and who has no means of evading it without
    suffering disgrace in his tribe. For this purpose, the custom, which is
    the common law of the land, allows him to use any means whatever, that
    he may deem necessary to bring the thing effectually about; and he is
    allowed to <em>waylay</em> and shoot down the criminal—so that punishment
    is <em>certain</em> and <em>cruel</em>, and as effective from the hands of
    a feeble, as from those of a stout man, and entirely beyond the hope
    that often arises from the “glorious uncertainty of the law.”</p>

  <p>As I have in a former place said, cruelty is one of the leading
    traits of the Indian’s character; and a little familiarity with their
    modes of life and government will soon convince the reader, that
    <em>certainty</em> and <em>cruelty</em> in punishments are requisite (where
    individuals undertake to inflict the penalties of the laws), in order
    to secure the lives and property of individuals in society.</p>

  <p>In the treatment of their prisoners also, in many tribes, they are
    in the habit of inflicting the most appalling tortures, for which
    the enlightened world are apt to condemn them as cruel and unfeeling
    in the extreme; without stopping to learn that in every one of these
    instances, these cruelties are practiced by way of retaliation, by
    individuals or families of the tribe, whose relatives have been
    previously dealt with in a similar way by their enemies, and whose
    <em>manes</em> they deem it their duty to appease by this horrid and
    cruel mode of retaliation.</p>

  <p>And in justice to the savage, the reader should yet know, that
    amongst these tribes that torture their prisoners, these cruelties
    are practiced but upon the few whose lives are required to atone for
    those who have been similarly dealt with by their enemies, and that
    the <em>remainder are adopted into the tribe</em>, by marrying the
    widows whose husbands have fallen in battle, in which capacity they
    are received and respected like others of the tribe, and enjoy equal
    rights and immunities. And before we condemn them too far, we should
    yet pause and enquire whether in the enlightened world we are not
    guilty of equal cruelties—whether in the ravages and carnage of war,
    and treatment of prisoners, we practice any virtue superior to this;
    and whether the annals of history which are familiar to all, do not
    furnish abundant proof of equal cruelty to prisoners of war, as well as
    in many instances, to the members of our own respective communities. It
    is a remarkable fact and one well recorded in history, as it deserves
    to be, to the honour of the savage, that no instance has been known
    of violence to their captive females, a virtue yet to be learned in
    civilized warfare.</p>

  <p>If their punishments are certain and cruel, they have the merit of
    being <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span><em>few</em>, and those confined chiefly to their enemies.
    It is natural to be cruel to enemies; and in this, I do not see
    that the improvements of the enlightened and Christian world have
    yet elevated them so very much above the savage. To their friends,
    there are no people on earth that are more kind; and cruelties and
    punishments (except for capital offences) are amongst themselves,
    entirely dispensed with. No man in their communities is subject to
    any restraints upon his liberty, or to any corporal or degrading
    punishment; each one valuing his limbs, and his liberty to use them as
    his inviolable right, which no power in the tribe can deprive him of;
    whilst each one holds the chief as amenable to him as the most humble
    individual in the tribe.</p>

  <p>On an occasion when I had interrogated a Sioux chief, on the Upper
    Missouri, about their Government—their punishments and tortures of
    prisoners, for which I had freely condemned them for the cruelty of the
    practice, he took occasion when I had got through, to ask <em>me</em>
    some questions relative to modes in the <em>civilized world</em>, which,
    with his comments upon them, were nearly as follow; and struck me, as I
    think they must every one, with great force.</p>

  <p>“Among white people, nobody ever take your wife—take your children—take
    your mother, cut off nose—cut eyes out—burn to death?” No! “Then
    <em>you</em> no cut off nose—<em>you</em> no cut out eyes—<em>you</em> no
    burn to death—very good.”</p>

  <p>He also told me he had often heard that white people hung their
    criminals by the neck and choked them to death like dogs, and those
    their own people; to which I answered, “yes.” He then told me he had
    learned that they shut each other up in prisons, where they keep them
    a great part of their lives <em>because they can’t pay money</em>! I
    replied in the affirmative to this, which occasioned great surprise
    and excessive laughter, even amongst the women. He told me that he
    had been to our Fort, at Council Bluffs, where we had a great many
    warriors and braves, and he saw three of them taken out on the prairies
    and tied to a post and whipped almost to death, and he had been told
    that they submit to all this to get a little money, “yes.” He said he
    had been told, that when all the white people were born, their white
    <em>medicine-men</em> had to stand by and look on—that in the Indian
    country the women would not allow that—they would be ashamed—that he
    had been along the Frontier, and a good deal amongst the white people,
    and he had seen them whip their little children—a thing that is very
    cruel—he had heard also, from several white <em>medicine-men</em>, that
    the Great Spirit of the white people was the child of a white woman,
    and that he was at last put to death by the white people! This seemed
    to be a thing that he had not been able to comprehend, and he concluded
    by saying, “the Indians’ Great Spirit got no mother—the Indians no
    kill him, he never die.” He put me a chapter of other questions, as
    to the trespasses of the white people on their lands—their continual
    corruption of the morals of their women—and digging open the Indians’
    graves to get their bones, &amp;c. To all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> which I was compelled to
    reply in the affirmative, and quite glad to close my note-book, and
    quietly to escape from the throng that had collected around me, and
    saying (though to myself and silently), that these and an hundred
    other vices belong to the civilized world, and are practiced upon (but
    certainly, in no instance, reciprocated by) the “cruel and relentless
    savage.”</p>

  <p>Of their modes of war, of which, a great deal has been written by other
    travellers—I could say much, but in the present place, must be brief.
    All wars, offensive or defensive, are decided on by the chiefs and
    doctors in council, where majority decides all questions. After their
    resolve, the chief conducts and leads—his pipe with the reddened stem
    is sent through the tribe by his <em>runners</em>, and every man who
    consents to go to war, draws the smoke once through its stem; he is
    then a <em>volunteer</em>, like all of their soldiers in war, and bound
    by no compulsive power, except that of pride, and dread of the disgrace
    of turning back. After the soldiers are enlisted, the war-dance
    is performed in presence of the whole tribe; when each warrior in
    warrior’s dress, with weapons in hand, dances up separately, and
    striking the reddened post, thereby takes the solemn oath not to desert
    his party.</p>

  <p>The chief leads in full dress to make himself as conspicuous a mark as
    possible for his enemy; whilst his men are chiefly denuded, and their
    limbs and faces covered with red earth or vermilion, and oftentimes
    with charcoal and grease, so as completely to disguise them, even from
    the knowledge of many of their intimate friends.</p>

  <p>At the close of hostilities, the two parties are often brought together
    by a flag of truce, where they sit in Treaty, and solemnize by smoking
    through the calumet or pipe of peace, as I have before described; and
    after that, their warriors and braves step forward, with the pipe of
    peace in the left hand, and the war-club in the right, and dance around
    in a circle—going through many curious and exceedingly picturesque
    evolutions in the “<em>pipe of peace dance</em>.”</p>

  <p>To each other I have found these people kind and honourable, and
    endowed with every feeling of parental, of filial, and conjugal
    affection, that is met in more enlightened communities. I have found
    them moral and religious: and I am bound to give them great credit for
    their zeal, which is often exhibited in their modes of worship, however
    insufficient they may seem to us, or may be in the estimation of the
    Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>I have heard it said by some very good men, and some who have even
    been preaching the Christian religion amongst them, that they have
    no religion—that all their zeal in their worship of the Great Spirit
    was but the foolish excess of ignorant superstition—that their humble
    devotions and supplications to the Sun and the Moon, where many of them
    suppose that the Great Spirit resides, were but the absurd rantings of
    idolatry. To such opinions as these I never yet gave answer, nor drew
    other instant inferences from them, than, that from the bottom of my
    heart, I pitied the persons who gave them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

  <p>I fearlessly assert to the world, (and I defy contradiction,) that the
    North American Indian is everywhere, in his native state, a highly
    moral and religious being, endowed by his Maker, with an intuitive
    knowledge of some great Author of his being, and the Universe; in dread
    of whose displeasure he constantly lives, with the apprehension before
    him, of a future state, where he expects to be rewarded or punished
    according to the merits he has gained or forfeited in this world.</p>

  <p>I have made this a subject of unceasing enquiry during all my travels,
    and from every individual Indian with whom I have conversed on the
    subject, from the highest to the lowest and most pitiably ignorant,
    I have received evidence enough, as well as from their numerous
    and humble modes of worship, to convince the mind, and elicit the
    confessions of, any man whose gods are not beaver and muskrats’
    skins—or whose ambition is not to be deemed an apostle, or himself,
    their only redeemer.</p>

  <p>Morality and virtue, I venture to say, the civilized world need not
    undertake to teach them; and to support me in this, I refer the reader
    to the interesting narrative of the Rev. Mr. Parker, amongst the tribes
    through and beyond the Rocky Mountains; to the narratives of Captain
    Bonneville, through the same regions; and also to the reports of the
    Reverend Messrs. Spalding and Lee, who have crossed the Mountains, and
    planted their little colony amongst them. And I am also allowed to
    refer to the account given by the Rev. Mr. Beaver, of the tribes in the
    vicinity of the Columbia and the Pacific Coast.</p>

  <p>Of their extraordinary modes and sincerity of worship, I speak with
    equal confidence; and although I am compelled to pity them for their
    ignorance, I am bound to say that I never saw any other people of any
    colour, who spend <em>so much of their lives</em> in humbling themselves
    before, and worshipping the Great Spirit, as some of these tribes do,
    nor any whom I would not as soon suspect of insincerity and hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>Self-denial, which is comparatively a word of no meaning in the
    enlightened world; and self-torture and almost self-immolation, are
    continual modes of appealing to the Great Spirit for his countenance
    and forgiveness; and these, not in studied figures of rhetoric,
    resounding in halls and synagogues, to fill and astonish the ears of
    the multitude; but humbly cried forth from starved stomachs and parched
    throats, from some lone and favourite haunts, where the poor penitents
    crawl and lay with their faces in the dirt from day to day, and day to
    day, sobbing forth their humble confessions of their sins, and their
    earnest implorations for divine forgiveness and mercy.</p>

  <p>I have seen man thus prostrating himself before his Maker, and
    worshipping as Nature taught him; and I have seen mercenary white
    man with his bottle and its associate vices, <em>unteaching</em> them;
    and after that, good and benevolent and pious men, devotedly wearing
    out their valuable lives, all but in vain, endeavouring to break
    down confirmed habits of cultivated vices and dissipation, and to
    engraft upon them the blessings of Christianity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> civilization.
    I have visited most of the stations, and am acquainted with many of
    the excellent missionaries, who, with their families falling by the
    diseases of the country about them, are zealously labouring to benefit
    these benighted people; but I have, with thousands and millions of
    others, to deplore the ill success with which their painful and
    faithful labours have generally been attended.</p>

  <p>This failure I attribute not to the want of capacity on the part of the
    savage, nor for lack of zeal and Christian endeavours of those who have
    been sent, and to whom the eyes of the sympathizing part of the world
    have been anxiously turned, in hopes of a more encouraging account.
    The misfortune has been, in my opinion, that these efforts have mostly
    been made in the wrong place—along the Frontier, where (though they
    have stood most in need of Christian advice and example) they have been
    the least ready to hear it or to benefit from its introduction; where
    whiskey has been sold for twenty, or thirty, or fifty years, and every
    sort of fraud and abuse that could be engendered and visited upon them,
    and amongst their families, by ingenious, <em>money-making</em> white
    man; rearing up under a burning sense of injustice, the most deadly and
    thwarting prejudices, which, and which alone, in my opinion, have stood
    in the way of the introduction of Christianity—of agriculture, and
    everything which virtuous society has attempted to teach them; which
    they meet and suspect, and reject as some new trick or enterprize of
    white man, which is to redound to his advantage rather than for their
    own benefit.</p>

  <p>The pious missionary finds himself here, I would venture to say, in
    an indescribable vicinity of mixed vices and stupid ignorance, that
    disgust and discourage him; and just at the moment when his new theory,
    which has been at first received as a mystery to them, is about to be
    successfully revealed and explained, the whiskey bottle is handed again
    from the bushes; and the poor Indian (whose perplexed mind is just
    ready to catch the brilliant illumination of Christianity), grasps it,
    and, like too many people in the enlightened world, quiets his excited
    feelings with its soothing draught, embracing most affectionately the
    friend that brings him the most sudden relief; and is contented to fall
    back, and linger—and die in the moral darkness that is about him.</p>

  <p>And notwithstanding the great waste of missionary labours, on many
    portions of our vast Frontier, there have been some instances in
    which their efforts have been crowned with signal success, (even with
    the counteracting obstacles that have stood in their way), of which
    instances I have made some mention in former epistles.</p>

  <p>I have always been, and still am, an advocate for missionary efforts
    amongst these people, but I never have had much faith in the success
    of any unless they could be made amongst the tribes in their primitive
    state; where, if the strong arm of the Government could be extended
    out to protect them, I believe that with the example of good and pious
    men, teaching them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> same time, agriculture and the useful arts,
    much could be done with these interesting and talented people, for the
    successful improvement of their moral and physical condition.</p>

  <p>I have ever thought, and still think, that the Indian’s mind is a
    beautiful blank, on which anything might be written, if the right mode
    were taken to do it.</p>

  <p>Could the enlightened and virtuous society of the East, have been
    brought in contact with him as his first neighbours, and his eyes been
    first opened to improvements and habits worthy of his imitation; and
    could religion have been taught him without the interference of the
    counteracting vices by which he is surrounded, the best efforts of the
    world would not have been thrown away upon him, nor posterity been left
    to say, in future ages, when he and his race shall have been swept from
    the face of the earth, that he was destined by Heaven to be unconverted
    and uncivilized.</p>

  <p>The Indian’s calamity is surely far this side of his origin—his
    misfortune has been in his education. Ever since our first acquaintance
    with these people on the Atlantic shores, have we regularly advanced
    upon them; and far a-head of good and moral society have their first
    teachers travelled (and are yet travelling), with vices and iniquities
    so horrible as to blind their eyes for ever to the light and loveliness
    of virtue, when she is presented to them.</p>

  <p>It is in the bewildering maze of this moving atmosphere that he, in
    his native simplicity, finds himself lost amidst the ingenuity and
    sophistry of his new acquaintance. He stands amazed at the arts and
    improvements of civilized life—his proud spirit which before was
    founded on his ignorance, droops, and he sinks down discouraged, into
    melancholy and despair; and at that moment grasps the bottle (which
    is ever ready), to soothe his anguished feelings to the grave. It
    is in this deplorable condition that the civilized world, in their
    approach, have ever found him; and here in his inevitable misery, that
    the charity of the world has been lavished upon him, and religion has
    exhausted its best efforts almost in vain.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this destructive ordeal, through which all the border
    tribes have had to pass, and of whom I have spoken but in general
    terms, there are striking and noble exceptions on the Frontiers, of
    individuals, and in some instances, of the remaining remnants of
    tribes, who have followed the advice and example of their Christian
    teachers; who have entirely discarded their habits of dissipation,
    and successfully outlived the dismal wreck of their tribe—having
    embraced, and are now preaching, the Christian religion; and proving
    by the brightest example, that they are well worthy of the sincere and
    well-applied friendship of the enlightened world, rather than their
    enmity and persecution.</p>

  <p>By nature they are decent and modest, unassuming and inoffensive—and
    all history (which I could quote to the end of a volume), proves them
    to have been found friendly and hospitable, on the first approach
    of white people to their villages on all parts of the American
    Continent—and from what I have <em>seen</em>, (which I offer as proof,
    rather than what I have <em>read</em>). I am willing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> proud to add,
    for the ages who are only to read of these people, my testimony to that
    which was given by the immortal Columbus, who wrote back to his Royal
    Master and Mistress, from his first position on the new Continent,
    “I swear to your Majesties, that there is not a better people in the
    world than these; more affectionate, affable, or mild. They love their
    neighbours as themselves, and they always speak smilingly.”</p>

  <p>They are ingenious and talented, as many of their curious manufactures
    will prove, which are seen by thousands in my Collection.</p>

  <p>In the <em>mechanic arts</em> they have advanced but little, probably
    because they have had but little use for them, and have had no teachers
    to bring them out. In the <em>fine arts</em>, they are perhaps still
    more rude, and their productions are very few. Their materials and
    implements that they work with, are exceedingly rare and simple; and
    their principal efforts at pictorial effects, are found on their
    buffalo robes; of which I have given some account in former Letters,
    and of which I shall herein furnish some additional information.</p>

  <p>I have been unable to find anything like a <em>system</em> of
    hieroglyphic writing amongst them; yet, their <em>picture writings</em>
    on the rocks, and on their robes, approach somewhat towards it. Of the
    former, I have seen a vast many in the course of my travels; and I have
    satisfied myself that they are generally the <em>totems</em> (symbolic
    names) merely, of Indians who have visited those places, and from a
    similar feeling of vanity that everywhere belongs to man much alike,
    have been in the habit of recording their names or symbols, such as
    birds, beasts, or reptiles; by which each family, and each individual,
    is generally known, as white men are in the habit of recording their
    names at watering places, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Many of these have recently been ascribed to the North-men, who
    probably discovered this country at an early period, and have been
    extinguished by the savage tribes. I might have subscribed to such a
    theory, had I not at the Red Pipe Stone Quarry, where there are a vast
    number of these inscriptions cut in the solid rock, and at other places
    also, seen the Indian at work, recording his totem amongst those of
    more ancient dates; which convinced me that they had been progressively
    made, at different ages, and without any system that could be called
    hieroglyphic writing.</p>

  <p>The paintings on their robes are in many cases exceedingly curious, and
    generally represent the exploits of their military lives, which they
    are proud of recording in this way and exhibiting on their backs as
    they walk.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">plates</span> 306 and 307, are <em>fac-similes</em> of the paintings
    on a Crow robe, which hangs in my Collection, amongst many others from
    various tribes; exhibiting the different tastes, and state of the fine
    arts, in the different tribes. All the groups on these two plates,
    are taken from one robe; and on the original, are quite picturesque,
    from the great variety of vivid colours which they have there given to
    them. The reader will recollect the robe Of <em>Mah-to-toh-pa</em>, which
    I described in the First Volume of this work. And he will find here,
    something very similar, the battles of a distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> war-chief’s
    life; all pourtrayed by his own hand, and displayed on his back as he
    walks, where all can read, and all of course are challenged to deny.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_308"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 308</a>, are <em>fac-simile</em> outlines from about
    one-half of a group on a Pawnee robe, also hanging in the exhibition;
    representing a procession of doctors or medicine-men, when one of them,
    the foremost one, is giving freedom to his favourite horse. This is
    a very curious custom, which I found amongst many of the tribes, and
    is done by his announcing to all of his fraternity, that on a certain
    day, he is going to give liberty to his faithful horse that has longest
    served him, and he expects them all to be present; at the time and
    place appointed, they all appear on horseback, most fantastically
    painted, and dressed, as well as armed and equipped; when the owner of
    the horse leads the procession, and drives before him his emancipated
    horse, which is curiously painted and branded; which he holds in check
    with a long laso. When they have arrived at the proper spot on the
    prairie, the ceremony takes place, of turning it loose, and giving it,
    it would seem, as a sort of sacrifice to the Great Spirit. This animal
    after this, takes his range amongst the bands of wild horses; and if
    caught by the laso, as is often the case, is discharged, under the
    superstitious belief that it belongs to the Great Spirit, and not with
    impunity to be appropriated by them.</p>

  <p>Besides this curious custom, there are very many instances where these
    magicians, (the avails of whose practice enable them to do it, in
    order to enthral the ignorant and superstitious minds of their people,
    as well as, perhaps, to quiet their own apprehensions,) sacrifice
    to the Great or Evil Spirit, their horses and dogs, by killing
    them instead of turning them loose. These sacrifices are generally
    made <em>immediately</em> to their <em>medicine-bags</em>, or to their
    <em>family-medicine</em>, which every family seems to have attached to
    their household, in addition to that which appropriately belongs to
    individuals. And in making these sacrifices, and all gifts to the
    Great Spirit, there is one thing yet to be told—that whatever gift
    is made, whether a horse, a dog, or other article, it is sure to be
    the <em>best</em> of its kind, that the giver possesses, otherwise he
    subjects himself to disgrace in his tribe, and to the ill-will of the
    power he is endeavouring to conciliate.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_309"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 309</a>, there is a <em>fac-simile</em> copy of the
    paintings on another Pawnee robe, the property and the designs of a
    distinguished doctor or medicine-man. In the centre he has represented
    himself in full dress on his favourite <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>horse; and, at the top and
    bottom, it would seem, he has endeavoured to set up his claims to the
    reputation of a warrior, with the heads of seven victims which he
    professes to have slain in battle. On the sides there are numerous
    figures, very curiously denoting his profession, where he is vomiting
    and purging his patients, with herbs; where also he has represented his
    <em>medicine</em> or totem, the Bear. And also the rising of the sun, and
    the different phases of the moon, which these magicians look to with
    great dependence for the operation of their charms and mysteries in
    effecting the cure of their patients.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_310"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 310</a>, is a further exemplification of symbolic
    representations, as well as of the state of the arts of drawing
    and design amongst these rude people. This curious chart is a
    <em>fac-simile</em> copy of an Indian song, which was drawn on a piece
    of birch bark, about twice the size of the plate, and used by the
    Chippeways preparatory to a <em>medicine-hunt</em>, as they term it. For
    the bear, the moose, the beaver, and nearly every animal they hunt for,
    they have certain seasons to commence, and previous to which, they
    “make medicine” for several days, to conciliate the bear (or other)
    Spirit, to ensure a successful season. For this purpose, these doctors,
    who are the only persons, generally, who are initiated into these
    profound secrets, sing forth, with the beat of the drum, the songs
    which are written in characters on these charts, in which all dance
    and join in the chorus; although they are generally as ignorant of the
    translation and meaning of the song, as a mere passing traveller; and
    which they have no means of learning, except by extraordinary claims
    upon the tribe, for their services as warriors and hunters; and then
    by an extraordinary fee to be given to the mystery-men, who alone can
    reveal them, and that under the most profound injunctions of secrecy.
    I was not initiated far enough in this tribe, to explain the mysteries
    that are hidden on this little chart, though I heard it sung over, and
    listened, (I am sure) at least one hour, before they had sung it all.</p>

  <p>Of these kinds of <em>symbolic writings</em>, and totems, such as are
    given in <a href="#i_311"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 311</a>, recorded on rocks and trees in the
    country, a volume might be filled; and from the knowledge which I
    have been able to obtain of them, I doubt whether I should be able
    to give with them all, much additional information, to that which I
    have briefly given in these few simple instances. Their <em>picture
    writing</em>, which is found on their robes, their wigwams, and
    different parts of their dress, is also voluminous and various; and can
    be best studied by the curious, on the numerous articles in the Museum,
    where they have the additional interest of having been traced by the
    Indian’s own hand.</p>

  <p>In <a href="#i_312"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 312</a>, is also a <em>fac-simile</em> of a Mandan robe,
    with a representation of the sun, most wonderfully painted upon it.
    This curious robe, which was a present from an esteemed friend of mine
    amongst those unfortunate people, is now in my Collection; where it may
    speak for itself, after this brief introduction.</p>

  <p>From these brief hints, which I have too hastily thrown together,
    it will be seen that these people are ingenious, and have much in
    their modes as well as in their manners, to enlist the attention of
    the merely curious, even if they should not be drawn nearer to them
    by feelings of sympathy and pity for their existing and approaching
    misfortunes.</p>

  <p>But he who can travel amongst them, or even sit down in his parlour,
    with his map of North America before him, with Halkett’s Notes on
    the History of the North American Indians (and several other very
    able works that have been written on their character and history),
    and fairly and truly contemplate the system of universal abuse, that
    is hurrying such a people to utter destruction, will find enough to
    enlist all his sympathies, and lead him to cultivate a more general and
    intimate acquaintance with their true character.</p>

  <p>He who will sit and contemplate that vast Frontier, where, by the past
    policy of the Government, one hundred and twenty thousand of these
    poor people, (who had just got initiated into the mysteries and modes
    of civilized life, surrounded by examples of industry and agriculture
    which they were beginning to adopt), have been removed several hundred
    miles to the West, to meet a second siege of the whiskey-sellers
    and traders in the wilderness, to whose enormous exactions their
    semi-civilized habits and appetites have subjected them, will assuredly
    pity them. Where they have to quit their acquired luxuries, or pay ten
    times their accustomed prices for them—and to scuffle for a few years
    upon the plains, with the wild tribes, and with white men also, for the
    flesh and the skins of the last of the buffaloes; where their carnage,
    but not their <em>appetites</em>, must stop in a few years, and with the
    ghastliness of hunger and despair, they will find themselves gazing
    at each other upon the vacant waste, which will afford them nothing
    but the empty air, and the desperate resolve to flee to the woods
    and fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains; whilst more lucky white man
    will return to his comfortable home, with no misfortune, save that of
    <em>deep remorse</em> and a <em>guilty conscience</em>. Such a reader will
    find enough to claim his pity and engage his whole soul’s indignation,
    at the wholesale and retail system of injustice, which has been, from
    the very first landing of our forefathers, (and is equally at the
    present day, being) visited upon these poor, and naturally unoffending,
    untrespassing people.</p>

  <p>In alluding to the cruel policy of removing the different tribes to
    their new country, West of the Mississippi, I would not do it without
    the highest respect to the motives of the Government—and to the
    feelings and opinions of those worthy Divines, whose advice and whose
    services were instrumental in bringing it about; and who, no doubt
    were of opinion that they were effecting a plan that would redound to
    the Indian’s benefit. Such was once my own opinion—but when I go, as I
    have done, through every one of those tribes removed, who had learned
    at home to use the ploughshare, and also contracted a passion, and
    a taste for civilized manufactures; and after that, removed twelve
    and fourteen hundred miles from their homes, to a district where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
    their wants are to be supplied by the traders, at eight or ten times
    the prices they have been in the habit of paying; where whiskey can
    easily be sold to them in a boundless and lawless forest, without the
    restraints that can be successfully put upon the sellers of it in their
    civilized neighbourhoods; and where also they are allured from the use
    of their ploughs, by the herds of buffaloes and other wild animals on
    the plains; I am compelled to state, as my irresistible conviction,
    that I believe the system one well calculated to benefit the interests
    of the voracious land-speculators and Indian Traders; the first of whom
    are ready to grasp at their lands, as soon as they are vacated—and the
    others, at the <em>annuities</em> of one hundred and twenty thousand
    extravagant customers. I believe the system is calculated to aid these,
    and perhaps to facilitate the growth and the wealth of the civilized
    border; but I believe, like everything else that tends to white man’s
    aggrandizement, and the increase of his wealth, it will have as rapid
    a tendency to the poverty and destruction of the poor <em>red men</em>;
    who, unfortunately, <em>almost</em> seem <em>doomed</em>, never in any way
    to be associated in interest with their pale-faced neighbours.</p>

  <p>The system of trade, and the small-pox, have been the great and
    wholesale destroyers of these poor people, from the Atlantic Coast to
    where they are now found. And no one but God, knows where the voracity
    of the one is to stop, short of the acquisition of everything that is
    desirable to money-making man in the Indian’s country; or when the
    mortal destruction of the other is to be arrested, whilst there is
    untried flesh for it to act upon, either within or beyond the Rocky
    Mountains.</p>

  <p>From the first settlements on the Atlantic Coast, to where it is now
    carried on at the base of the Rocky Mountains, there has been but one
    system of trade and money-making, by hundreds and thousands of white
    men, who are desperately bent upon making their fortunes in this trade,
    with the unsophisticated children of the forest; and generally they
    have succeeded in the achievement of their object.</p>

  <p>The Governments of the United States, and Great Britain, have always
    held out every encouragement to the Fur Traders, whose traffic has
    uniformly been looked upon as beneficial, and a source of wealth
    to nations; though surely, they never could have considered such
    intercourse as advantageous to the savage.</p>

  <p>Besides the many thousands who are daily and hourly selling whiskey
    and rum, and useless gewgaws, to the Indians on the United States,
    the Canada, the Texan and Mexican borders, there are, of hardy
    adventurers, in the Rocky Mountains and beyond, or near them, and out
    of all limits of laws, one thousand armed men in the annual employ of
    the United States’ Fur Companies—an equal number in the employment of
    the British Factories, and twice that number in the Russian and Mexican
    possessions; all of whom pervade the countries of the wildest tribes
    they can reach, with guns and gunpowder in their hands, and other
    instruments of death, unthought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> by the simple savage, calculated
    to terrify and coerce him to favourable terms in his trade; and in all
    instances they assume the right, (and prove it, if necessary, by the
    superiority of their weapons,) of hunting and trapping the streams and
    lakes of their countries.</p>

  <p>These traders, in addition to the terror, and sometimes death, that
    they carry into these remote realms, at the muzzles of their guns, as
    well as by whiskey and the small-pox, are continually arming tribe
    after tribe with firearms; who are able thereby, to bring their
    unsuspecting enemies into unequal combats, where they are slain by
    thousands, and who have no way to heal the awful wound but by arming
    themselves in turn; and in a similar manner reeking their vengeance
    upon <em>their</em> defenceless enemies on the West. In this wholesale
    way, and by whiskey and disease, tribe after tribe sink their heads and
    lose their better, proudest half, before the next and succeeding waves
    of civilization flow on, to see or learn anything definite of them.</p>

  <p>Without entering at this time, into any detailed history of this
    immense system, or denunciation of any of the men or their motives, who
    are engaged in it, I would barely observe, that, from the very nature
    of their traffic, where their goods are to be carried several thousands
    of miles, on the most rapid and dangerous streams, over mountains and
    other almost discouraging obstacles; and that at the continual hazard
    to their lives, from accidents and diseases of the countries, the poor
    Indians are obliged to pay such enormous prices for their goods, that
    the balance of trade is so decidedly against them, as soon to lead
    them to poverty; and, unfortunately for them, they mostly contract a
    taste for whiskey and rum, which are not only ruinous in their prices,
    but in their effects destructive to life—destroying the Indians, much
    more rapidly than an equal indulgence will destroy the civilized
    constitution.</p>

  <p>In the Indian communities, where there is no law of the land or custom
    denominating it a vice to drink whiskey, and to get drunk; and where
    the poor Indian meets whiskey tendered to him by white men, whom he
    considers wiser than himself, and to whom lie naturally looks for
    example; he thinks it no harm to drink to excess, and will lie drunk
    as long as he can raise the means to pay for it. And after his first
    means, in his wild state, are exhausted, he becomes a beggar for
    whiskey, and begs until he disgusts, when the honest pioneer becomes
    his neighbour; and then, and not before, gets the name of the “poor,
    degraded, naked, and drunken Indian,” to whom the epithets are well and
    truly applied.</p>

  <p>On this great system of carrying the Fur Trade into the Rocky Mountains
    and other parts of the wilderness country, where whiskey is sold at
    the rate of twenty and thirty dollars per gallon, and most other
    articles of trade at a similar rate; I know of no better comment, nor
    any more excusable, than the quotation of a few passages from a very
    popular work, which is being read with great avidity, from the pen of a
    gentleman whose name gives currency to any book, and whose fine taste,
    pleasure to all who read. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> work I refer to “The Rocky Mountains,
    or Adventures in the Far West, by W. Irving,” is a very interesting
    one; and its incidents, no doubt, are given with great candour, by
    the excellent officer, Captain Bonneville, who spent five years in
    the region of the Rocky Mountains, on a furlough; endeavouring, in
    competition with others, to add to his fortune, by pushing the Fur
    Trade to some of the wildest tribes in those remote regions.</p>

  <p>“The worthy Captain (says the Author) started into the country with
    110 men; whose very appearance and equipment exhibited a piebald
    mixture—half-civilized and half-savage, &amp;c.” And he also preludes
    his work by saying, that it was revised by himself from Captain
    Bonneville’s own notes, which can, no doubt, be relied on.</p>

  <p>This medley group, it seems, traversed the country to the Rocky
    Mountains, where, amongst the Nez Percés and Flatheads, he says, “They
    were friendly in their dispositions, and honest to the most scrupulous
    degree in their intercourse with the white men. And of the same people,
    the Captain continues—Simply to call these people religious, would
    convey but a faint idea of the deep hue of piety and devotion which
    pervades the whole of their conduct. Their honesty is immaculate; and
    their purity of purpose, and their observance of the rites of their
    religion, are most uniform and remarkable. They are, certainly, more
    like a nation of saints than a horde of savages.”</p>

  <p>Afterwards, of the “<em>Root-Diggers</em>,” in the vicinity of the
    Great Salt Lake, who are a band of the Snake tribe, (and of whom he
    speaks thus:—“In fact, they are a simple, timid, inoffensive race,
    and scarce provided with any weapons, except for the chase”); he says
    that, “one morning, one of his trappers, of a violent and savage
    character, discovering that his traps had been carried off in the
    night, took a horrid oath that he would kill the first Indian he should
    meet, innocent or guilty. As he was returning with his comrades to
    camp, he beheld two unfortunate Root-Diggers seated on the river bank
    fishing—advancing upon them, he levelled his rifle, shot one upon the
    spot, and flung his bleeding body into the stream.”</p>

  <p>A short time afterwards, when his party of trappers “were about to
    cross Ogden’s river, a great number of Shoshokies or Root-Diggers
    were posted on the opposite bank, when they <em>imagined</em> they were
    there with hostile intent; they advanced upon them, levelled their
    rifles, and killed twenty-five of them on the spot. The rest fled to
    a short distance, then halted and turned about, howling and whining
    like wolves, and uttering most piteous wailings. The trappers chased
    them in every direction; the poor wretches made no defence, but fled
    with terror; neither does it appear from the accounts of the boasted
    victors, that a weapon had been wielded, or a weapon launched by the
    Indians throughout the affair.”</p>

  <p>After this affair, this “piebald” band of trappers wandered off to
    Monterey, on the coast of California, and on their return on horseback
    through an immense tract of the Root-Diggers’ country, he gives the
    further following accounts of their transactions:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

  <p>“In the course of their journey through the country of the poor
    Root-Diggers, there seems to have been an emulation between them,
    which could inflict the greatest outrages upon the natives. The
    trappers still considered them in the light of dangerous foes; and the
    Mexicans, very probably, charged them with the sin of horse-stealing;
    we have no other mode of accounting for the infamous barbarities, of
    which, according to their own story, they were guilty—hunting the poor
    Indians like wild beasts, and killing them without mercy—chasing their
    unfortunate victims at full speed; noosing them around the neck with
    their lasos, and then dragging them to death.”</p>

  <p>It is due to Captain Bonneville, that the world should know that these
    cruel (not “<em>savage</em>”) atrocities were committed by his men, when
    they were on a Tour to explore the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and
    many hundreds of miles from him, and beyond his controul; and that in
    his work, both the Captain and the writer of the book have expressed in
    a proper way, their abhorrence of such fiendish transactions.</p>

  <p>A part of the same “piebald mixture” of trappers, who were encamped in
    the Riccaree country, and trapping the beavers out of their streams,
    when, finding that the Riccarees had stolen a number of their horses
    one night, in the morning made prisoners of two of the Riccarees, who
    loitered into their camp, and probably without knowledge of the offence
    committed, when they were bound hand and foot as hostages, until every
    one of the horses should be returned.</p>

  <p>“The mountaineers declared, that unless the horses were relinquished,
    the prisoners should be burned to death. To give force to their threat,
    a pyre of logs and faggots was heaped up and kindled into a blaze.
    The Riccarees released one horse, and then another; but finding that
    nothing but the relinquishment of all their spoils would purchase the
    lives of their captives, they abandoned them to their fate, moving off
    with many parting words and howlings, when the prisoners were dragged
    to the blazing pyre, and burnt to death in sight of their retreating
    comrades.</p>

  <p>“Such are the savage cruelties that white men learn to practice, who
    mingle in savage life; and such are the acts that lead to terrible
    recrimination on the part of the Indians. Should we hear of any
    atrocities committed by the Riccarees upon captive white men; let this
    signal and recent provocation be born in mind. Individual cases of the
    kind dwell in the recollections of whole tribes—and it is a point of
    honour and conscience to revenge them.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

  <p>To quote the author further———“The facts disclosed in the present
    work, clearly manifest the policy of establishing military posts, and
    a mounted force to protect our Traders in their journeys across the
    great Western wilds; and of pushing the outposts into the heart of the
    singular wilderness we have laid open, so as to maintain some degree of
    sway over the country, and to put an end to the kind of ‘black mail,’
    levied on all occasions, by the savage ‘chivalry of the mountains’”!</p>

  <p>The appalling cruelties in the above quotations require no comment;
    and I hope the author, as well as the Captain, who have my warmest
    approbation for having so frankly revealed them, will pardon me
    for having quoted them in this place, as one striking proof of the
    justice that may be reasonably expected, in <em>prospect</em>; and that
    may fairly be laid to the <em>past</em> proceedings of these great
    systems of trading with, and civilizing the savages; which have been
    carried on from the beginning of our settlements on the Atlantic
    Coast, to the present day—making first acquaintance with them, and
    first impressions of the glorious effects of civilization—and of the
    sum total of which, this instance is but a mere point; but with the
    singular merit which redounds to the honour of Captain Bonneville,
    that he has frankly told the whole truth; which, if as fully revealed
    of <em>all other transactions in these regions</em>, I am enabled to
    say, would shake every breast with ague-chills of abhorrence of
    <em>civilized</em> barbarities. From the above facts, as well as from
    others enumerated in the foregoing epistles, the discerning reader
    will easily see how prejudices are raised in the minds of the savage,
    and why so many murders of white people are heard of on the Frontier,
    which are uniformly attributed to the wanton cruelty and rapacity
    of the savage—which we denominate “Indian murders,” and “ruthless
    barbarities,” before we can condescend to go to the poor savage, and
    ask him for a reason, which there is no doubt he could generally
    furnish us.</p>

  <p>From these, and hundreds of others that might be named, and equally
    barbarous, it can easily be seen, that white men may well feel a dread
    at every step they take in Indian realms, after atrocities like these,
    that call so loudly and so justly for revenge, in a country where there
    are no laws to punish; but where the cruel savage takes vengeance in
    his own way—and white men fall, in the Indian’s estimation, not as
    <em>murdered</em>, but <em>executed</em>, under the common law of their
    land.</p>

  <p>Of the hundreds and thousands of such <em>murders</em>, as they are
    denominated by white men, who are the only ones to tell of them in the
    civilized world; it should also be kept in mind by the reader, who
    passes his sentence on them, that they are all committed on Indian
    ground—that the Indian hunts not, nor traps anywhere on white man’s
    soil, nor asks him for his lands—or molests the sacred graves where
    they have deposited the bones of their fathers, their wives and their
    little children.</p>

  <p>I have said that the principal means of the destruction of these
    people, were the system of trade, and the introduction of small-pox,
    the infallible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> plague that is consequent, sooner or later, upon the
    introduction of trade and whiskey-selling to every tribe. I would
    venture the assertion, from books that I have searched, and from other
    evidence, that of the numerous tribes which have already disappeared,
    and of those that have been traded with, quite to the Rocky Mountains,
    each one has had this exotic disease in their turn—and in a few months
    have lost one half or more of their numbers; and that from living
    evidences, and distinct traditions, this appalling disease has several
    times, before our days, run like a wave through the Western tribes,
    over the Rocky Mountains, and to the Pacific Ocean—thinning the ranks
    of the poor Indians to an extent which no knowledge, save that of the
    overlooking eye of the Almighty, can justly comprehend.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <p>I have travelled faithfully and far, and have closely scanned, with
    a hope of fairly pourtraying the condition and customs of these
    unfortunate people; and if in taking leave of my readers, which I must
    soon do, they should censure me for any oversight, or any indiscretion
    or error, I will take to myself these consoling reflections, that they
    will acquit me of intention to render more or less than justice to
    any one; and also, that if in my zeal to render a service and benefit
    to the Indian, I should have fallen short of it, I will, at least, be
    acquitted of having done him an <em>injury</em>. And in endeavouring
    to render them that justice, it belongs to me yet to say that the
    introduction of the fatal causes of their destruction above-named,
    has been a subject of close investigation with me during my travels;
    and I have watched on every part of the Frontier their destructive
    influences, which result in the overthrow of the savage tribes, which,
    one succeeding another, are continually becoming extinct under their
    baneful influences. And before I would expatiate upon any system for
    their successful improvement and preservation, I would protrude my
    opinion to the world, which I regret to do, that so long as the past
    and present system of trade and whiskey-selling is tolerated amongst
    them, there is little hope for their improvement, nor any chance for
    more than a temporary existence. I have closely studied the Indian
    character in its native state, and also in its secondary form along our
    Frontiers; civilized, as it is often (but incorrectly) called. I have
    seen it in every phase, and although there are many noble instances to
    the contrary, and with many of whom I am personally acquainted; yet
    the greater part <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>of those who have lingered along the Frontiers, and
    been kicked about like dogs, by white men, and beaten into a sort of a
    civilization, are very far from being what I would be glad to see them,
    and proud to call them, civilized by the aids and examples of good and
    moral people. Of the Indians in their general capacity of civilized,
    along our extensive Frontier, and those tribes that I found in their
    primitive and disabused state, I have drawn a Table, which I offer
    as an estimate of their comparative character, which I trust will be
    found to be near the truth, generally, though like all general rules or
    estimates, with its exceptions. (Vide Appendix C.)</p>

  <p>Such are the results to which the present system of civilization brings
    that small part of these poor unfortunate people, who outlive the
    first calamities of their country; and in this degraded and pitiable
    condition, the most of them end their days in poverty and wretchedness,
    without the power of rising above it. Standing on the soil which
    they have occupied from their childhood, and inherited from their
    fathers; with the dread of “pale faces,” and the deadly prejudices that
    have been reared in their breasts against them, for the destructive
    influences which they have introduced into their country, which have
    thrown the greater part of their friends and connexions into the grave,
    and are now promising the remainder of them no better prospect than
    the dreary one of living a few years longer, and then to sink into the
    ground themselves; surrendering their lands and their fair hunting
    grounds to the enjoyment of their enemies, and their bones to be dug up
    and strewed about the fields, or to be labelled in our Museums.</p>

  <p>For the Christian and philanthropist, in any part of the world, there
    is enough, I am sure, in the character, condition, and history of
    these unfortunate people, to engage his sympathies—for the Nation,
    there is an unrequited account of sin and injustice that sooner or
    later will call for <em>national retribution</em>—and for the American
    citizens, who live, every where proud of their growing wealth and their
    luxuries, over the bones of these poor fellows, who have surrendered
    their hunting-grounds and their lives, to the enjoyment of their
    cruel dispossessors, there is a lingering terror yet, I fear, for the
    reflecting minds, whose mortal bodies must soon take their humble
    places with their red, but injured brethren, under the same glebe; to
    appear and stand, at last, with guilt’s shivering conviction, amidst
    the myriad ranks of accusing spirits, that are to rise in their own
    fields, at the final day of resurrection!</p>

      have been correctly translated to me; and I think it will at once he
      decided, that there is very little affinity or resemblance, if any,
      between them. I have therein given a sample of the Blackfoot language,
      yet, of that immense tribe who all class under the name of Blackfoot,
      there are the Cotonnés and the Grosventres des Prairies—whose languages
      are entirely distinct from this—and also from each other—and in the
      same region, and neighbours to them, are also the Chayennes—the

      languages are as distinct, and as widely different, as those that I

  <div class="subheadc">EXTINCTION OF THE MANDANS.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">From</span> the accounts brought to New York in the fall of 1838, by Messrs.
    M‘Kenzie, Mitchell, and others, from the Upper Missouri, and with whom
    I conversed on the subject, it seems that in the summer of that year
    the small-pox was accidentally introduced amongst the Mandans, by the
    Fur Traders; and that in the course of two months they all perished,
    except some thirty or forty, who were taken as slaves by the Riccarees;
    an enemy living two hundred miles below them, and who moved up and
    took possession of their village soon after their calamity, taking up
    their residence in it, it being a better built village than their own;
    and from the lips of one of the Traders who had more recently arrived
    from there, I had the following account of the remaining few, in whose
    destruction was the final termination of this interesting and once
    numerous tribe.</p>

  <p>The Riccarees, he said, had taken possession of the village after the
    disease had subsided, and after living some months in it, were attacked
    by a large party of their enemies, the Sioux, and whilst fighting
    desperately in resistance, in which the Mandan prisoners had taken an
    active part, the latter had concerted a plan for their own destruction,
    which was effected by their simultaneously running through the piquets
    on to the prairie, calling out to the Sioux (both men and women) to
    kill them, “that they were Riccaree dogs, that their friends were all
    dead, and they did not wish to live,”—that they here wielded their
    weapons as desperately as they could, to excite the fury of their
    enemy, and that they were thus cut to pieces and destroyed.</p>

  <p>The accounts given by two or three white men, who were amongst the
    Mandans during the ravages of this frightful disease, are most
    appalling and actually too heart-rending and disgusting to be recorded.
    The disease was introduced into the country by the Fur Company’s
    steamer from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis; which had two of their crew sick with the
    disease when it approached the Upper Missouri, and imprudently stopped
    to trade at the Mandan village, which was on the bank of the river,
    where the chiefs and others were allowed to come on board, by which
    means the disease got ashore.</p>

  <p>I am constrained to believe, that the gentlemen in charge of the
    steamer did not believe it to be the small-pox; for if they had known
    it to be such, I cannot conceive of such imprudence, as regarded
    their own interests in the country, as well as the fate of these poor
    people, by allowing their boat to advance into the country under such
    circumstances.</p>

  <p>It seems that the Mandans were surrounded by several war-parties of
    their more powerful enemies the Sioux, at that unlucky time, and they
    could not therefore disperse upon the plains, by which many of them
    could have been saved; and they were necessarily enclosed within the
    piquets of their village, where the disease in a few days became so
    very malignant that death ensued in a few hours after its attacks; and
    so slight were their hopes when they were attacked, that nearly half
    of them destroyed themselves with their knives, with their guns, and
    by dashing their brains out by leaping head-foremost from a thirty
    foot ledge of rocks in front of their village. The first symptom of
    the disease was a rapid swelling of the body, and so very virulent
    had it become, that very many died in two or three hours after their
    attack, and that in many cases without the appearance of the disease
    upon the skin. Utter dismay seemed to possess all classes and all ages,
    and they gave themselves up in despair, as entirely lost. There was
    but one continual crying and howling and praying to the Great Spirit
    for his protection during the nights and days; and there being but few
    living, and those in too appalling despair, nobody thought of burying
    the dead, whose bodies, whole families together, were left in horrid
    and loathsome piles in their own wigwams, with a few buffalo robes, &amp;c.
    thrown over them, there to decay, and be devoured by their own dogs.
    That such a proportion of their community as that above-mentioned,
    should have perished in so short a time, seems yet to the reader, an
    unaccountable thing; but in addition to the causes just mentioned, it
    must be borne in mind that this frightful disease is everywhere far
    more fatal amongst the native than in civilized population, which may
    be owing to some extraordinary constitutional susceptibility; or, I
    think, more probably, to the exposed lives they live, leading more
    directly to fatal consequences. In this, as in most of their diseases,
    they ignorantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> and imprudently plunge into the coldest water, whilst
    in the highest state of fever, and often die before they have the power
    to get out.</p>

  <p>Some have attributed the unexampled fatality of this disease amongst
    the Indians to the fact of their living entirely on animal food; but
    so important a subject for investigation I must leave for sounder
    judgments than mine to decide. They are a people whose constitutions
    and habits of life enable them most certainly to meet most of its
    ills with less dread, and with decidedly greater success, than they
    are met in civilized communities; and I would not dare to decide that
    their simple meat diet was the cause of their fatal exposure to one
    frightful disease, when I am decidedly of opinion that it has been the
    cause of their exemption and protection from another, almost equally
    destructive, and, like the former, of civilized introduction.</p>

  <p>During the season of the ravages of the Asiatic cholera which swept
    over the greater part of the western country, and the Indian frontier,
    I was a traveller through those regions, and was able to witness its
    effects; and I learned from what I saw, as well as from what I have
    heard in other parts since that time, that it travelled to and over the
    frontiers, carrying dismay and death amongst the tribes on the borders
    in many cases, so far as they had adopted the civilized modes of life,
    with its dissipations, using vegetable food and salt; but wherever it
    came to the tribes living exclusively on meat, and that without the
    use of salt, its progress was suddenly stopped. I mention this as a
    subject which I looked upon as important to science, and therefore one
    on which I made many careful enquiries; and so far as I have learned
    along that part of the frontier over which I have since passed, I have
    to my satisfaction ascertained that such became the utmost limits of
    this fatal disease in its travel to the West, unless where it might
    have followed some of the routes of the Fur Traders, who, of course,
    have introduced the modes of civilized life.</p>

  <p>From the Trader who was present at the destruction of the Mandans I had
    many most wonderful incidents of this dreadful scene, but I dread to
    recite them. Amongst them, however, there is one that I must briefly
    describe, relative to the death of that noble <em>gentleman</em> of whom
    I have already said so much, and to whom I became so much attached,
    <em>Mah-to-toh-pa</em>, or “the Four Bears.” This fine fellow sat in his
    wigwam and watched every one of his family die about him, his wives and
    his little children, after he had recovered from the disease himself;
    when he walked out, around the village, and wept over the final
    destruction of his tribe; his braves and warriors, whose sinewy arms
    alone he could depend on for a continuance of their existence, all laid
    low; when he came back to his lodge, where he covered his whole family
    in a pile, with a number of robes, and wrapping another around himself,
    went out upon a hill at a little distance, where he laid several days,
    despite all the solicitations of the Traders, resolved to <em>starve</em>
    himself to death. He remained there till the sixth day, when he had
    just strength enough to creep back to the village, when he entered the
    horrid gloom of his own wigwam, and laying his body alongside of the
    group of his family, drew his robe over him and died on the ninth day
    of his fatal abstinence.</p>

  <p>So have perished the friendly and hospitable Mandans, from the best
    accounts I could get; and although it may be <em>possible</em> that some
    few individuals may yet be remaining, I think it is not probable; and
    one thing is certain, even if such be the case, that, as a nation, the
    Mandans are extinct, having no longer an existence.</p>

  <p>There is yet a melancholy part of the tale to be told, relating to
    the ravages of this frightful disease in that country on the same
    occasion, as it spread to other contiguous tribes, to the Minatarees,
    the Knisteneaux, the Blackfeet, the Chayennes and Crows; amongst whom
    25,000 perished in the course of four or five months, which most
    appalling facts I got from Major Pilcher, now Superintendent of Indian
    affairs at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, from Mr. M‘Kenzie, and others.</p>

  <p>It may be naturally asked here, by the reader, whether the Government
    of the United States have taken any measures to prevent the ravages
    of this fatal disease amongst these exposed tribes; to which I
    answer, that repeated efforts have been made, and so far generally,
    as the tribes have ever had the disease, (or, at all events, within
    the recollections of those who are now living in the tribes,) the
    Government agents have succeeded in introducing vaccination as a
    protection; but amongst those tribes in their wild state, and where
    they have not suffered with the disease, very little success has
    been met with in the attempt to protect them, on account of their
    superstitions, which have generally resisted all attempts to introduce
    vaccination. Whilst I was on the Upper Missouri, several surgeons were
    sent into the country with the Indian agents, where I several times
    saw the attempts made without success. They have perfect confidence
    in the skill of their own physicians, until the disease has made one
    slaughter in their tribe, and then, having seen white men amongst them
    protected by it, they are disposed to receive it, before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>which they
    cannot believe that so minute a puncture in the arm is going to protect
    them from so fatal a disease; and as they see white men so earnestly
    urging it, they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of pale
    faces, by which they are to gain some new advantage over them, and they
    stubbornly and successfully resist it.</p>

  <h3>THE WELSH COLONY.</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Which I barely spoke of in page 206, of Vol. <abbr title="one">I.</abbr> which sailed under the
    direction of Prince Madoc, or Madawc, from North Wales, in the early
    part of the fourteenth century in ten ships, according to numerous
    and accredited authors, and never returned to their own country, have
    been supposed to have landed somewhere on the coast of North or South
    America; and from the best authorities, (which I will suppose everybody
    has read, rather than quote them at this time,) I believe it has been
    pretty clearly proved that they landed either on the coast of Florida
    or about the mouth of the Mississippi, and according to the history and
    poetry of their country, settled somewhere in the interior of North
    America, where they are yet remaining, intermixed with some of the
    savage tribes.</p>

  <p>In my Letter just referred to, I barely suggested, that the Mandans,
    whom I found with so many peculiarities in looks and customs, which
    I have already described, might possibly be the remains of this lost
    colony, amalgamated with a tribe, or part of a tribe, of the natives,
    which would account for the unusual appearances of this tribe of
    Indians, and also for the changed character and customs of the Welsh
    Colonists, provided these be the remains of them.</p>

  <p>Since those notes were written, as will have been seen by my subsequent
    Letters, and particularly in <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a> of this Volume, I have descended
    the Missouri river from the Mandan village to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, a distance
    of 1800 miles, and have taken pains to examine its shores; and from
    the repeated remains of the ancient locations of the Mandans, which
    I met with on the banks of that river, I am fully convinced that I
    have traced them down nearly to the mouth of the Ohio river; and from
    exactly similar appearances, which I recollect to have seen several
    years since in several places in the interior of the state of Ohio,
    I am fully convinced that they have formerly occupied that part of
    the country, and have, from some cause or other, been put in motion,
    and continued to make their repeated moves until they arrived at the
    place of their residence at the time of their extinction, on the Upper
    Missouri.</p>

  <p>In the annexed chart of the Missouri and Ohio rivers, will be seen laid
    down the different positions of the ancient marks of their towns which
    I have examined; and also, nearly, (though not exactly) the positions
    of the very numerous civilized fortifications which are now remaining
    on the Ohio and Muskingum rivers, in the vicinity of which I believe
    the Mandans once lived.</p>

  <p>These ancient fortifications, which are very numerous in that vicinity,
    some of which enclose a great many acres, and being built on the
    banks of the rivers, with walls in some places twenty or thirty feet
    in height, with covered ways to the water, evince a knowledge of the
    science of fortifications, apparently not a century behind that of the
    present day, were evidently never built by any nation of savages in
    America, and present to us incontestable proof of the former existence
    of a people very far advanced in the arts of civilization, who have,
    from some cause or other, disappeared, and left these imperishable
    proofs of their former existence.</p>

  <p>Now I am inclined to believe that the ten ships of Madoc, or a part
    of them at least, entered the Mississippi river at the Balize, and
    made their way up the Mississippi, or that they landed somewhere on
    the Florida coast, and that their brave and persevering colonists made
    their way through the interior, to a position on the Ohio river, where
    they cultivated their fields, and established in one of the finest
    countries on earth, a flourishing colony; but were at length set
    upon by the savages, whom, perhaps, they provoked to warfare, being
    trespassers on their hunting-grounds, and by whom, in overpowering
    hordes, they were beseiged, until it was necessary to erect these
    fortifications for their defence, into which they were at last driven
    by a confederacy of tribes, and there held till their ammunition
    and provisions gave out, and they in the end have all perished,
    except, perhaps, that portion of them who might have formed alliance
    by marriage with the Indians, and their offspring, who would have
    been half-breeds, and of course attached to the Indians’ side; whose
    lives have been spared in the general massacre; and at length, being
    despised, as all half-breeds of enemies are, have gathered themselves
    into a band, and severing from their parent tribe, have moved off, and
    increased in numbers and strength as they have advanced up the Missouri
    river to the place where they have been known for many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> years past by
    the name of the <em>Mandans</em>, a corruption or abbreviation, perhaps,
    of “<em>Madawgwys</em>,” the name applied by the Welsh to the followers
    of Madawc.</p>

  <p>If this be a startling theory for the world, they will be the more
    sure to read the following brief reasons which I bring in support of
    my opinion; and if they do not support me, they will at least be worth
    knowing, and may, at the same time, be the means of eliciting further
    and more successful enquiry.</p>

  <p>As I have said, in <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a> of this Volume, and in other places, the
    marks of the Mandan villages are known by the excavations of two feet
    or more in depth, and thirty or forty feet in diameter, of a circular
    form, made in the ground for the foundations of their wigwams, which
    leave a decided remain for centuries, and one that is easily detected
    the moment that it is met with. After leaving the Mandan village, I
    found the marks of their former residence about sixty miles below where
    they were then living, and from which they removed (from their own
    account) about sixty or eighty years since; and from the appearance of
    the number of their lodges, I should think, that at that recent date
    there must have been three times the number that were living when I
    was amongst them. Near the mouth of the big Shienne river, 200 miles
    below their last location, I found still more ancient remains, and in
    as many as six or seven other places between that and the mouth of the
    Ohio, as I have designated on the chart, and each one, as I visited
    them, appearing more and more ancient, convincing me that these people,
    wherever they might have come from, have gradually made their moves up
    the banks of the Missouri, to the place where I visited them.</p>

  <p>For the most part of this distance they have been in the heart of the
    great Sioux country, and being looked upon by the Sioux as trespassers,
    have been continually warred upon by this numerous tribe, who have
    endeavoured to extinguish them, as they have been endeavouring to do
    ever since our first acquaintance with them; but who, being always
    fortified by a strong piquet, or stockade, have successfully withstood
    the assaults of their enemies, and preserved the remnant of their
    tribe. Through this sort of gauntlet they have run, in passing through
    the countries of these warlike and hostile tribes.</p>

  <p>It may be objected to this, perhaps, that the Riccarees and Minatarees
    build their wigwams in the same way: but this proves nothing, for the
    Minatarees are Crows, from the north-west; and by their own showing,
    fled to the Mandans for protection, and forming their villages by the
    side of them, built their wigwams in the same manner.</p>

  <p>The Riccarees have been a very small tribe, far inferior to the
    Mandans; and by the traditions of the Mandans, as well as from the
    evidence of the first explorers, Lewis and Clarke, and others, have
    lived, until quite lately, on terms of intimacy with the Mandans, whose
    villages they have successively occupied as the Mandans have moved and
    vacated them, as they now are doing, since disease has swept the whole
    of the Mandans away.</p>

  <p>Whether my derivation of the word <em>Mandan</em> from <em>Madawgwys</em>
    be correct or not, I will pass it over to the world at present merely
    as <em>presumptive</em> proof, for want of better, which, perhaps, this
    enquiry may elicit; and, at the same time, I offer the Welsh word
    <em>Mandon</em>, (the woodroof, a species of madder used as a red dye,)
    as the name that might possibly have been applied by their Welsh
    neighbours to these people, on account of their very ingenious mode of
    giving the beautiful red and other dyes to the porcupine quills with
    which they garnish their dresses.</p>

  <p>In their own language they called themselves
    <em>See-pohs-ka-nu-mah-ka-kee</em>, (the people of the pheasants,) which
    was probably the name of the primitive stock, before they were mixed
    with any other people; and to have got such a name, it is natural to
    suppose that they must have come from a country where <em>pheasants</em>
    existed, which cannot be found short of reaching the timbered country
    at the base of the Rocky Mountains, some six or eight hundred miles
    West of the Mandans, or the forests of Indiana and Ohio, some hundreds
    of miles to the South and East of where they last lived.</p>

  <p>The above facts, together with the other one which they repeatedly
    related to me, and which I have before alluded to, that they had often
    been to the hill of the <em>Red Pipe Stone</em>, and that they once
    lived near it, carry conclusive evidence, I think, that they have
    formerly occupied a country much farther to the South; and that they
    have repeatedly changed their locations, until they reached the spot of
    their last residence, where they have met with their final misfortune.
    And as evidence in support of my opinion that they came from the banks
    of the Ohio, and have brought with them some of the customs of the
    civilized people who erected those ancient fortifications, I am able
    to say, that the numerous specimens of pottery which have been taken
    from the graves and tumuli about those ancient works, (many of which
    may be seen now, in the Cincinnati Museum, and some of which, my own
    donations, and which have so much surprised the enquiring world,) were
    to be seen in great numbers in the use of the Mandans, and scarcely a
    day in the summer, when the visitor to their village would not see the
    women at work with their hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> fingers, moulding them from black
    clay, into vases, cups, pitchers, and pots, and baking them in their
    little kilns in the sides of the hill, or under the bank of the river.</p>

  <p>In addition to this art, which I am sure belongs to no other tribe on
    the Continent, these people have also, as a secret with themselves, the
    extraordinary art of manufacturing a very beautiful and lasting kind of
    blue glass beads, which they wear on their necks in great quantities,
    and decidedly value above all others that are brought amongst them by
    the Fur Traders.</p>

  <p>This secret is not only one that the Traders did not introduce amongst
    them, but one that they cannot learn from them; and at the same time,
    beyond a doubt, an art that has been introduced amongst them by some
    civilized people, as it is as yet unknown to other Indian tribes in
    that vicinity, or elsewhere. Of this interesting fact, Lewis and
    Clarke have given an account thirty-three years ago, at a time when no
    Traders, or other white people, had been amongst the Mandans, to have
    taught them so curious an art.</p>

  <p>The Mandan canoes which are altogether different from those of
    all other tribes, are exactly the Welsh <em>coracle</em>, made of
    <em>raw-hides</em>, the skins of buffaloes, stretched underneath a frame
    made of willow or other boughs, and shaped nearly round, like a tub;
    which the woman carries on her head from her wigwam to the water’s
    edge, and having stepped into it, stands in front, and propels it
    by dipping her paddle <em>forward</em>, and <em>drawing it to her</em>,
    instead of paddling by the side. In referring to <a href="#i_240"><span class="smcap">plate</span> 240</a>,
    letter <i>c</i>, <a href="#Page_138">page 138</a>, the reader will see several drawings of
    these seemingly awkward crafts, which, nevertheless, the Mandan women
    will <em>pull</em> through the water at a rapid rate.</p>

  <p>How far these extraordinary facts may go in the estimation of the
    reader, with numerous others which I have mentioned in Volume <abbr title="one">I.</abbr>,
    whilst speaking of the Mandans, of their various complexions, colours
    of hair, and blue and grey eyes, towards establishing my opinion as
    a sound theory, I cannot say; but this much I can safely aver, that
    at the moment that I first saw these people, I was so struck with
    the peculiarity of their appearance, that I was under the instant
    conviction that they were an amalgam of a native, with some civilized
    race; and from what I have seen of them, and of the remains on the
    Missouri and Ohio rivers, I feel fully convinced that these people have
    emigrated from the latter stream; and that they have, in the manner
    that I have already stated, with many of their customs, been preserved
    from the <em>almost total</em> destruction of the bold colonists of
    Madawc, who, I believe, settled upon and occupied for a century or so,
    the rich and fertile banks of the Ohio. In adducing the proof for the
    support of this theory, it I have failed to complete it, I have the
    satisfaction that I have not taken up much of the reader’s time, and
    I can therefore claim his attention a few moments longer, whilst I
    refer him to a brief vocabulary of the Mandan language in the following
    pages, where he may compare it with that of the Welsh; and better,
    perhaps, than I can, decide whether there is any affinity existing
    between the two; and if he finds it, it will bring me a friendly aid in
    support of the position I have taken.</p>

  <p>From the comparison, that I have been able to make, I think I am
    authorized to say, that in the following list of words, which form a
    part of that vocabulary, there is a striking similarity, and quite
    sufficient to excite surprise in the minds of the attentive reader,
    if it could be proved that those resemblances were but the results of
    accident between two foreign and distinct idioms.</p>

  <p>The following brief Vocabularies of several different Indian languages,
    which have been carefully written by the Author from the lips of the
    Indians as they have pronounced them, and which he has endeavoured
    to convey with the simplest use of the English alphabet, have been
    repeatedly referred to in the text, as a conclusive proof of the
    radical difference that actually exists amongst a vast many of the
    languages spoken by the North American Indians. And the Author here
    repeats, as he has said in <a href="#Page_236">page 236</a>, that of the forty-eight languages
    which he has visited, he pronounces thirty of them as radically
    different as these are, whilst the remaining eighteen may be said to be
    dialects from four or five distinct roots.</p>
